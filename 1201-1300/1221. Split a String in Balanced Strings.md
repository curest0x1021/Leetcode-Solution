## Problem

**Balanced** strings are those that have an equal quantity of ```'L'``` and ```'R'``` characters.

Given a **balanced** string ```s```, split it into some number of substrings such that:


	
- Each substring is balanced.


Return **the **maximum** number of balanced strings you can obtain.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= s.length <= 1000```
	
- ```s[i]``` is either ```'L'``` or ```'R'```.
	
- ```s``` is a **balanced** string.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int balancedStringSplit(String s) {
        int i = 0;
        int balancedCount = 0;
        int lCount = 0;
        int rCount = 0;
        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'L') {
                lCount++;
            } else {
                rCount++;
            }
            i++;
            if (lCount != 0 && lCount == rCount) {
                lCount = 0;
                rCount = 0;
                balancedCount++;
            }
        }
        return balancedCount;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
