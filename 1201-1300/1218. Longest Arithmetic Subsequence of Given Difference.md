## Problem

Given an integer array ```arr``` and an integer ```difference```, return the length of the longest subsequence in ```arr``` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals ```difference```.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from ```arr``` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= arr.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubsequence(int[] arr, int difference) {
        int res = 0;
        int[] dp = new int[20001];
        for (int j : arr) {
            int cur = j + 10000;
            int last = j - difference + 10000;
            if (last < 0 || last > 20000) {
                dp[cur] = Math.max(dp[cur], 1);
            } else {
                dp[cur] = Math.max(dp[cur], dp[last] + 1);
            }
            res = Math.max(res, dp[cur]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.
