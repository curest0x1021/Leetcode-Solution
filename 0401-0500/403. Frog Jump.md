## Problem

A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of ```stones```' positions (in units) in sorted **ascending order**, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be ```1``` unit.

If the frog's last jump was ```k``` units, its next jump must be either ```k - 1```, ```k```, or ```k + 1``` units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
Output: true
Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= stones.length <= 2000```
	
- ```0 <= stones[i] <= 231 - 1```
	
- ```stones[0] == 0```
	
- ```stones``` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} stones
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canCross = function(stones) {
  const search = (start, target) => {
    let end = stones.length - 1
    while (start <= end) {
      const middle = Math.floor(start + (end - start) / 2)
      if (stones[middle] === target) {
        return middle
      } if (stones[middle] < target) {
        start = middle + 1
      } else {
        end = middle - 1
      }
    }
    return -1
  }
  const memo = []
  const aux = (index, k) => {
    memo[index] = memo[index] || []
    if (memo[index][k] !== undefined) {
      return memo[index][k]
    }
    if (index === stones.length - 1) {
      return true
    }
    if (index === 0) {
      const nextIndex = search(1, 1)
      if (nextIndex === -1) {
        return false
      }
      return aux(nextIndex, 1)
    }
    let valid = false
    const next1 = search(index + 1, stones[index] + k - 1)
    if (next1 > -1) {
      valid = valid || aux(next1, k - 1)
      if (valid) {
        return true
      }
    }
    const next2 = search(index + 1, stones[index] + k)
    if (next2 > -1) {
      valid = valid || aux(next2, k)
      if (valid) {
        return true
      }
    }
    const next3 = search(index + 1, stones[index] + k + 1)
    if (next3 > -1) {
      valid = valid || aux(next3, k + 1)
      if (valid) {
        return true
      }
    }
    memo[index][k] = valid
    return memo[index][k]
  }
  return aux(0, 1)
};
```
