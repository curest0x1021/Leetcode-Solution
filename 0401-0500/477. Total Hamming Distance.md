## Problem

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given an integer array ```nums```, return **the sum of **Hamming distances** between all the pairs of the integers in** ```nums```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,14,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
showing the four bits relevant in this case).
The answer will be:
HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,14,4]
Output: 4
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 10^4```
	
- ```0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9```
	
- The answer for the given input will fit in a **32-bit** integer.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalHammingDistance(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int ones = 0;
            for (int k : nums) {
                ones += ((k >> i) & 1);
            }
            ans = ans + (ones * (n - ones));
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
