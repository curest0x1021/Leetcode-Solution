## Problem

Given a string ```s```, sort it in **decreasing order** based on the **frequency** of the characters. The **frequency** of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return **the sorted string**. If there are multiple answers, return **any of them**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5```
	
- ```s``` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        TreeMap<Integer, List<Character>> reverseMap = new TreeMap<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        for (Map.Entry<Character, Integer> c : map.entrySet()) {
            int freq = map.get(c.getKey());
            reverseMap.computeIfAbsent(freq, k -> new ArrayList<>());
            reverseMap.get(freq).add(c.getKey());
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, List<Character>> freq : reverseMap.entrySet()) {
            List<Character> list = reverseMap.get(freq.getKey());
            for (char c : list) {
                for (int i = 0; i < freq.getKey(); i++) {
                    sb.append(c);
                }
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
