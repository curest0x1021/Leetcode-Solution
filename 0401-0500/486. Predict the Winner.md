## Problem

You are given an integer array ```nums```. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of ```0```. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., ```nums[0]``` or ```nums[nums.length - 1]```) which reduces the size of the array by ```1```. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return ```true``` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return ```true```. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 20```
	
- ```0 <= nums[i] <= 10^7```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean PredictTheWinner(int[] nums) {
        int[][] gain = new int[nums.length][nums.length];
        for (int k = 0; k < nums.length; k ++) {
            for (int i = 0; i + k < nums.length; i ++) {
                if (k == 0) {
                    gain[i][i + k] = nums[i];
                }
                else if (k == 1) {
                    gain[i][i + k] = Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i + k]);
                }
                else {
                    gain[i][i + k] = Math.max(gain[i][i] - gain[i + 1][i + k], gain[i + k][i + k] - gain[i][i + k - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return gain[0][nums.length - 1] >= 0;
    }
}
```
