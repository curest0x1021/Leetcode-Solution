## Problem

Given an integer array ```nums```, return **the number of all the **arithmetic subsequences** of** ```nums```.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three elements** and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.


	
- For example, ```[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]```, ```[7, 7, 7, 7]```, and ```[3, -1, -5, -9]``` are arithmetic sequences.
	
- For example, ```[1, 1, 2, 5, 7]``` is not an arithmetic sequence.


A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.


	
- For example, ```[2,5,10]``` is a subsequence of ```[1,2,1,**2**,4,1,**5**,**10**]```.


The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in **32-bit** integer.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 16
Explanation: Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1  <= nums.length <= 1000```
	
- ```-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1```



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfArithmeticSlices = function(nums) {
  const max = nums.length

  if (max <= 2) {
    return 0
  }

  let ans = 0
  const dp = new Array(max).fill(0).map(() => new Map())
  for (let i = 1; i < max; i++) {
    const item = nums[i]
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      const pre = nums[j]
      const diff = item - pre
      dp[i].set(diff, (dp[i].get(diff) || 0) + 1)
      if (dp[j].get(diff)) {
        dp[i].set(diff, dp[i].get(diff) + dp[j].get(diff))
        ans += dp[j].get(diff)
      }
    }  
  }
  return ans
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
