## Problem

You are given a string ```s``` of lowercase English letters and an integer array ```shifts``` of the same length.

Call the ```shift()``` of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that ```'z'``` becomes ```'a'```).


	
- For example, ```shift('a') = 'b'```, ```shift('t') = 'u'```, and ```shift('z') = 'a'```.


Now for each ```shifts[i] = x```, we want to shift the first ```i + 1``` letters of ```s```, ```x``` times.

Return **the final string after all such shifts to s are applied**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
Output: "rpl"
Explanation: We start with "abc".
After shifting the first 1 letters of s by 3, we have "dbc".
After shifting the first 2 letters of s by 5, we have "igc".
After shifting the first 3 letters of s by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaa", shifts = [1,2,3]
Output: "gfd"
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 105```
	
- ```s``` consists of lowercase English letters.
	
- ```shifts.length == s.length```
	
- ```0 <= shifts[i] <= 109```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public String shiftingLetters(String s, int[] shifts) {
        int n = shifts.length;
        int runningSum = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            shifts[i] = (shifts[i] + runningSum) % 26;
            runningSum = shifts[i];
        }
        StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            int correctShift = (c - 'a' + shifts[i]) % 26;
            str.append((char) ('a' + correctShift));
            i++;
        }
        return str.toString();
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
