## Problem

There are ```n``` workers. You are given two integer arrays ```quality``` and ```wage``` where ```quality[i]``` is the quality of the ```ith``` worker and ```wage[i]``` is the minimum wage expectation for the ```ith``` worker.

We want to hire exactly ```k``` workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of ```k``` workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:


	
- Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
	
- Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.


Given the integer ```k```, return **the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions**. Answers within ```10-5``` of the actual answer will be accepted.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], k = 2
Output: 10^5.00000
Explanation: We pay 70 to 0th worker and 35 to 2nd worker.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], k = 3
Output: 30.66667
Explanation: We pay 4 to 0th worker, 13.33333 to 2nd and 3rd workers separately.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == quality.length == wage.length```
	
- ```1 <= k <= n <= 10^4```
	
- ```1 <= quality[i], wage[i] <= 10^4```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public double mincostToHireWorkers(int[] quality, int[] wage, int k) {
        int n = quality.length;
        Worker[] workers = new Worker[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            workers[i] = new Worker(wage[i], quality[i]);
        }
        Arrays.sort(workers, Comparator.comparingDouble(Worker::ratio));

        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(b, a));
        int sumQuality = 0;
        double result = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Worker worker = workers[i];
            sumQuality += worker.quality;
            maxHeap.add(worker.quality);
            if (maxHeap.size() > k) {
                sumQuality -= maxHeap.remove();
            }
            double groupRatio = worker.ratio();
            if (maxHeap.size() == k) {
                result = Math.min(sumQuality * groupRatio, result);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    static class Worker {
        int wage;
        int quality;

        double ratio() {
            return (double) wage / quality;
        }

        Worker(int wage, int quality) {
            this.wage = wage;
            this.quality = quality;
        }
    }
}
```
