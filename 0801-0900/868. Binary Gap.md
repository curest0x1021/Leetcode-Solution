## Problem

Given a positive integer ```n```, find and return **the **longest distance** between any two **adjacent** **```1```**'s in the binary representation of **```n```**. If there are no two adjacent **```1```**'s, return **```0```**.**

Two ```1```'s are **adjacent** if there are only ```0```'s separating them (possibly no ```0```'s). The **distance** between two ```1```'s is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two ```1```'s in ```"1001"``` have a distance of 3.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 22
Output: 2
Explanation: 22 in binary is "10110".
The first adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 2.
The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 1.
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
Note that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 8
Output: 0
Explanation: 8 in binary is "1000".
There are not any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 in binary is "101".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 109```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int binaryGap(int n) {
        int max = 0;
        int pos = 0;
        int lastPos = -1;
        while (n != 0) {
            pos++;
            if ((n & 1) == 1) {
                if (lastPos != -1) {
                    max = Math.max(max, pos - lastPos);
                }
                lastPos = pos;
            }
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
