## Problem

Given two strings ```s``` and ```goal```, return ```true```** if you can swap two letters in **```s```** so the result is equal to **```goal```**, otherwise, return **```false```**.**

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices ```i``` and ```j``` (0-indexed) such that ```i != j``` and swapping the characters at ```s[i]``` and ```s[j]```.


	
- For example, swapping at indices ```0``` and ```2``` in ```"abcd"``` results in ```"cbad"```.


 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 10^4```
	
- ```s``` and ```goal``` consist of lowercase letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean buddyStrings(String s, String goal) {
        int first = -1;
        int second;
        int[] sCounts = new int[26];
        if (s.equals(goal)) {
            for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
                sCounts[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
                if (sCounts[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] > 1) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char curr = s.charAt(i);
            sCounts[curr - 'a']++;
            if (curr != goal.charAt(i)) {
                if (first == -1) {
                    first = i;
                } else {
                    second = i;
                    char[] ss = s.toCharArray();
                    char temp = ss[first];
                    ss[first] = ss[second];
                    ss[second] = temp;
                    return String.valueOf(ss).equals(goal);
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
