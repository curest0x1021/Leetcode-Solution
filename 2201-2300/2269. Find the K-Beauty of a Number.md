## Problem

The **k-beauty** of an integer ```num``` is defined as the number of **substrings** of ```num``` when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:


	
- It has a length of ```k```.
	
- It is a divisor of ```num```.


Given integers ```num``` and ```k```, return **the k-beauty of **```num```.

Note:


	
- **Leading zeros** are allowed.
	
- ```0``` is not a divisor of any value.


A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 240, k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
- "24" from "240": 24 is a divisor of 240.
- "40" from "240": 40 is a divisor of 240.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 430043, k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
- "30" from "430043": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "00" from "430043": 0 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "04" from "430043": 4 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= num <= 109```
	
- ```1 <= k <= num.length``` (taking ```num``` as a string)



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int divisorSubstrings(int num, int k) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int count = 0;
        String s = String.valueOf(num);
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (i < s.length() && j < s.length()) {
            sb.append(s.charAt(j) - '0');
            int val = Integer.parseInt(sb.toString());
            if (j - i + 1 == k) {
                if (val != 0 && num % val == 0) {
                    count++;
                }
                sb.deleteCharAt(0);
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
