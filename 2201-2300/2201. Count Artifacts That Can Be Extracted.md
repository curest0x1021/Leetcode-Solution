## Problem

There is an ```n x n``` **0-indexed** grid with some artifacts buried in it. You are given the integer ```n``` and a **0-indexed **2D integer array ```artifacts``` describing the positions of the rectangular artifacts where ```artifacts[i] = [r1i, c1i, r2i, c2i]``` denotes that the ```ith``` artifact is buried in the subgrid where:


	
- ```(r1i, c1i)``` is the coordinate of the **top-left** cell of the ```ith``` artifact and
	
- ```(r2i, c2i)``` is the coordinate of the **bottom-right** cell of the ```ith``` artifact.


You will excavate some cells of the grid and remove all the mud from them. If the cell has a part of an artifact buried underneath, it will be uncovered. If all the parts of an artifact are uncovered, you can extract it.

Given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array ```dig``` where ```dig[i] = [ri, ci]``` indicates that you will excavate the cell ```(ri, ci)```, return **the number of artifacts that you can extract**.

The test cases are generated such that:


	
- No two artifacts overlap.
	
- Each artifact only covers at most ```4``` cells.
	
- The entries of ```dig``` are unique.


 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/16/untitled-diagram.jpg)

```
Input: n = 2, artifacts = [[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1]], dig = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
The different colors represent different artifacts. Excavated cells are labeled with a 'D' in the grid.
There is 1 artifact that can be extracted, namely the red artifact.
The blue artifact has one part in cell (1,1) which remains uncovered, so we cannot extract it.
Thus, we return 1.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/16/untitled-diagram-1.jpg)

```
Input: n = 2, artifacts = [[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1]], dig = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Both the red and blue artifacts have all parts uncovered (labeled with a 'D') and can be extracted, so we return 2. 
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 1000```
	
- ```1 <= artifacts.length, dig.length <= min(n2, 105)```
	
- ```artifacts[i].length == 4```
	
- ```dig[i].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= r1i, c1i, r2i, c2i, ri, ci <= n - 1```
	
- ```r1i <= r2i```
	
- ```c1i <= c2i```
	
- No two artifacts will overlap.
	
- The number of cells covered by an artifact is **at most** ```4```.
	
- The entries of ```dig``` are unique.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int digArtifacts(int n, int[][] artifacts, int[][] dig) {
        int[][] ar = new int[n][n];
        for (int[] ints : dig) {
            ar[ints[0]][ints[1]] = 1;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int[] artifact : artifacts) {
            int x1 = artifact[0];
            int y1 = artifact[1];
            int x2 = artifact[2];
            int y2 = artifact[3];
            int flag = 0;
            int a = x1;
            int b = y1;
            while (a <= x2) {
                b = y1;
                while (b <= y2) {
                    if (ar[a][b] != 1) {
                        flag = 1;
                        break;
                    }
                    b++;
                }
                if (flag == 1) {
                    break;
                }
                a++;
            }
            if (a == x2 + 1 && b == y2 + 1) {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
