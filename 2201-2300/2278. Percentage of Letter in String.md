## Problem

Given a string ```s``` and a character ```letter```, return** the **percentage** of characters in **```s```** that equal **```letter```** **rounded down** to the nearest whole percent.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "foobar", letter = "o"
Output: 33
Explanation:
The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'o' is 2 / 6 * 100% = 33% when rounded down, so we return 33.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "jjjj", letter = "k"
Output: 0
Explanation:
The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'k' is 0%, so we return 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 100```
	
- ```s``` consists of lowercase English letters.
	
- ```letter``` is a lowercase English letter.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int percentageLetter(String s, char letter) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = s.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == letter) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
        return (count * 100) / (n);
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
