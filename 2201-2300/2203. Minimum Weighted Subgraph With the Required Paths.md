## Problem

You are given an integer ```n``` denoting the number of nodes of a **weighted directed** graph. The nodes are numbered from ```0``` to ```n - 1```.

You are also given a 2D integer array ```edges``` where ```edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]``` denotes that there exists a **directed** edge from ```fromi``` to ```toi``` with weight ```weighti```.

Lastly, you are given three **distinct** integers ```src1```, ```src2```, and ```dest``` denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.

Return **the **minimum weight** of a subgraph of the graph such that it is **possible** to reach** ```dest``` **from both** ```src1``` **and** ```src2``` **via a set of edges of this subgraph**. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return ```-1```.

A **subgraph** is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The **weight** of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/17/example1drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5
Output: 9
Explanation:
The above figure represents the input graph.
The blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.
Note that the subgraph [[1,0,3],[0,5,6]] also yields the optimal answer. It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/02/17/example2-1drawio.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[2,1,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 2
Output: -1
Explanation:
The above figure represents the input graph.
It can be seen that there does not exist any path from node 1 to node 2, hence there are no subgraphs satisfying all the constraints.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```3 <= n <= 10^5```
	
- ```0 <= edges.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```edges[i].length == 3```
	
- ```0 <= fromi, toi, src1, src2, dest <= n - 1```
	
- ```fromi != toi```
	
- ```src1```, ```src2```, and ```dest``` are pairwise distinct.
	
- ```1 <= weight[i] <= 10^5```

    public long minimumWeight(int n, int[][] edges, int src1, int src2, int dest) {
        List<int[]>[] graph = new List[n];
        long[][] weight = new long[3][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                weight[j][i] = Long.MAX_VALUE;
            }
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

            Node curr = queue.poll();
            if (curr.vertex == dest && curr.index == 2) {
                return curr.weight;
            }
            for (int[] next : graph[curr.vertex]) {

                    weight[curr.index][next[0]] = curr.weight + next[1];
                    queue.offer(new Node(curr.index, next[0], weight[curr.index][next[0]]));
                } else if (weight[curr.index][next[0]] > curr.weight + next[1]) {
                    weight[curr.index][next[0]] = curr.weight + next[1];
                    queue.offer(new Node(curr.index, next[0], weight[curr.index][next[0]]));
                    if (weight[curr.index ^ 1][next[0]] != Long.MAX_VALUE
                            && weight[curr.index][next[0]] + weight[curr.index ^ 1][next[0]]
                                    < weight[2][next[0]]) {
                        weight[2][next[0]] =
                                weight[curr.index][next[0]] + weight[curr.index ^ 1][next[0]];
                        queue.offer(new Node(2, next[0], weight[2][next[0]]));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    private static class Node {
        int index;
        int vertex;
        long weight;

        Node(int index, int vertex, long weight) {
            this.index = index;
            this.vertex = vertex;
            this.weight = weight;
