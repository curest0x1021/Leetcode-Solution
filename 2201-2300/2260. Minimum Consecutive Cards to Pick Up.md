## Problem

You are given an integer array ```cards``` where ```cards[i]``` represents the **value** of the ```ith``` card. A pair of cards are **matching** if the cards have the **same** value.

Return** the **minimum** number of **consecutive** cards you have to pick up to have a pair of **matching** cards among the picked cards.** If it is impossible to have matching cards, return ```-1```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cards = [1,0,5,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= cards.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```0 <= cards[i] <= 10^6```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumCardPickup(int[] cards) {
        int mindiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int n = cards.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(cards[i])) {
                int j = map.get(cards[i]);
                mindiff = Math.min(mindiff, i - j + 1);
            }
            map.put(cards[i], i);
        }
        if (mindiff == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            return -1;
        }
        return mindiff;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
