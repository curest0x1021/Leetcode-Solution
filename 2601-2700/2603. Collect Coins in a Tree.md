## Problem

There exists an undirected and unrooted tree with `n` nodes indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array edges of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree. You are also given an array `coins` of size `n` where `coins[i]` can be either `0` or `1`, where `1` indicates the presence of a coin in the vertex `i`.

Initially, you choose to start at any vertex in the tree. Then, you can perform the following operations any number of times:

- Collect all the coins that are at a distance of at most `2` from the current vertex, or
- Move to any adjacent vertex in the tree.

Find **the minimum number of edges you need to go through to collect all the coins and go back to the initial vertex**.

Note that if you pass an edge several times, you need to count it into the answer several times.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/03/01/graph-2.png)

```
Input: coins = [1,0,0,0,0,1], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Start at vertex 2, collect the coin at vertex 0, move to vertex 3, collect the coin at vertex 5 then move back to vertex 2.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/03/02/graph-4.png)

```
Input: coins = [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[5,6],[5,7]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Start at vertex 0, collect the coins at vertices 4 and 3, move to vertex 2,  collect the coin at vertex 7, then move back to vertex 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == coins.length`
- `1 <= n <= 3 * 104`
- `0 <= coins[i] <= 1`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- `edges` represents a valid tree.

## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int collectTheCoins(int[] coins, int[][] edges) {
        int n = coins.length;
        Set<Integer>[] tree = new HashSet[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            tree[i] = new HashSet();
        }

        // Build the tree from the edges
        for (int[] e : edges) {
            tree[e[0]].add(e[1]);
            tree[e[1]].add(e[0]);
        }

        // Find the leaves with zero coins
        List<Integer> leaf = new ArrayList();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int u = i;
            while (tree[u].size() == 1 && coins[u] == 0) {
                int v = tree[u].iterator().next();
                tree[u].remove(v);
                tree[v].remove(u);
                u = v;
            }
            if (tree[u].size() == 1) {
                leaf.add(u);
            }
        }

        // Remove the leaves one by one
        for (int sz = 2; sz > 0; --sz) {
            List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList();
            for (int u : leaf) {
                if (tree[u].size() == 1) {
                    int v = tree[u].iterator().next();
                    tree[u].remove(v);
                    tree[v].remove(u);
                    if (tree[v].size() == 1) {
                        temp.add(v);
                    }
                }
            }
            leaf = temp;
        }

        // Count the remaining edges in the tree
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            ans += tree[i].size();
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
