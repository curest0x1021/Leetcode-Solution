## Problem

You have an ```inventory``` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants ```orders``` balls of **any** color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls **of that color **you currently have in your ```inventory```. For example, if you own ```6``` yellow balls, the customer would pay ```6``` for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only ```5``` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at ```5``` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, ```inventory```, where ```inventory[i]``` represents the number of balls of the ```ith``` color that you initially own. You are also given an integer ```orders```, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls **in any order**.

Return **the **maximum** total value that you can attain after selling **```orders```** colored balls**. As the answer may be too large, return it **modulo **```10^9 + 7```.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/jj.gif)

```
Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).
The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: inventory = [3,5], orders = 6
Output: 19
Explanation: Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).
The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= inventory.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```1 <= inventory[i] <= 10^9```
	
- ```1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 10^9)```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] inventory, int orders) {
        int n = inventory.length;
        long mod = (long) 1e9 + 7;
        long totalValue = 0;
        Arrays.sort(inventory);
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            count++;
            if (i == 0 || inventory[i] > inventory[i - 1]) {
                long diff = i == 0 ? inventory[i] : inventory[i] - inventory[i - 1];
                if (count * diff < orders) {
                    totalValue += (2L * inventory[i] - diff + 1) * diff * count / 2 % mod;
                    orders -= count * diff;
                } else {
                    diff = orders / count;
                    long remainder = orders % count;
                    totalValue += (2L * inventory[i] - diff + 1) * diff * count / 2 % mod;
                    totalValue += (inventory[i] - diff) * remainder % mod;
                    totalValue %= mod;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return (int) totalValue;
    }
}
```
