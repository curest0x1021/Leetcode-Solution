## Problem

You are given an integer array ```nums``` and an integer ```k```.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals ```k``` and remove them from the array.

Return **the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9```
	
- ```1 <= k <= 10^9```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        int count = 0;
        while (start < end) {
            int sum = nums[start] + nums[end];
            if (sum == k) {
                count++;
                start++;
                end--;
            } else if (sum < k) {
                start++;
            } else {
                end--;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
