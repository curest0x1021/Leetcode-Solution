## Problem

A string ```s``` is called **good** if there are no two different characters in ```s``` that have the same **frequency**.

Given a string ```s```, return** the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make **```s```** **good**.**

The **frequency** of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string ```"aab"```, the **frequency** of ```'a'``` is ```2```, while the **frequency** of ```'b'``` is ```1```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already good.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "ceabaacb"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```s``` contains only lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletions(String s) {
        int cnt = 0;
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            while (freq[i] > 0 && seen.contains(freq[i])) {
                freq[i]--;
                cnt++;
            }
            seen.add(freq[i]);
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
