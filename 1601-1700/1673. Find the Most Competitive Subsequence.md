## Problem

Given an integer array ```nums``` and a positive integer ```k```, return **the most** competitive** subsequence of **```nums``` **of size **```k```.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence ```a``` is more **competitive** than a subsequence ```b``` (of the same length) if in the first position where ```a``` and ```b``` differ, subsequence ```a``` has a number **less** than the corresponding number in ```b```. For example, ```[1,3,4]``` is more competitive than ```[1,3,5]``` because the first position they differ is at the final number, and ```4``` is less than ```5```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
Output: [2,6]
Explanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4
Output: [2,3,3,4]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9```
	
- ```1 <= k <= nums.length```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] mostCompetitive(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] r = new int[k];
        int n = nums.length;
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == 0) {
                r[j] = nums[i];
                j++;
            } else {
                int l = j - 1;
                while ((l >= 0) && (nums[i] < r[l]) && ((n - i) >= (k - l))) {
                    l--;
                }
                j = l + 1;
                if (j < k) {
                    r[j] = nums[i];
                    j++;
                }
            }
        }
        return r;
    }
}
```
