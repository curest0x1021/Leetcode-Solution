## Problem

Given an integer ```n```, you must transform it into ```0``` using the following operations any number of times:


	
- Change the rightmost (```0th```) bit in the binary representation of ```n```.
	
- Change the ```ith``` bit in the binary representation of ```n``` if the ```(i-1)th``` bit is set to ```1``` and the ```(i-2)th``` through ```0th``` bits are set to ```0```.


Return **the minimum number of operations to transform **```n```** into **```0```**.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
"11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
"01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
"110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
"010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.
"011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
"001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```0 <= n <= 10^9```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {
        return calc(calculateOneIndex(n));
    }

    private int calc(LinkedList<Integer> indices) {
        if (indices.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        int index = indices.removeLast();
        return stepOfExp(index) - calc(indices);
    }

    private LinkedList<Integer> calculateOneIndex(int n) {
        LinkedList<Integer> result = new LinkedList<>();
        int index = 1;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n % 2 == 1) {
                result.add(index);
            }
            n >>= 1;

            index++;
        }
        return result;
    }

    private int stepOfExp(int index) {
        int result = 1;
        while (index > 0) {
            result <<= 1;
            index--;
        }
        return result - 1;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
