## Problem

Given ```n``` ```points``` on a 2D plane where ```points[i] = [xi, yi]```, Return** the **widest vertical area** between two points such that no points are inside the area.**

A **vertical area** is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The **widest vertical area** is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points **on the edge** of a vertical area **are not** considered included in the area.

 
**Example 1:**

​
```
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == points.length```
	
- ```2 <= n <= 10^5```
	
- ```points[i].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= xi, yi <= 10^9```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points) {
        int[] xValues = new int[points.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            xValues[i] = points[i][0];
        }
        Arrays.sort(xValues);
        int max = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < xValues.length - 1; j++) {
            if (xValues[j + 1] - xValues[j] > max) {
                max = xValues[j + 1] - xValues[j];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
