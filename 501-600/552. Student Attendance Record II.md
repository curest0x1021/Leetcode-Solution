# 552. Student Attendance Record II

## Problem

An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:


	
- ```'A'```: Absent.
	
- ```'L'```: Late.
	
- ```'P'```: Present.


Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet **both** of the following criteria:


	
- The student was absent (```'A'```) for **strictly** fewer than 2 days **total**.
	
- The student was **never** late (```'L'```) for 3 or more **consecutive** days.


Given an integer ```n```, return **the **number** of possible attendance records of length** ```n```** that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it **modulo** **```109 + 7```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 records with length 2 that are eligible for an award:
"PP", "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
Only "AA" is not eligible because there are 2 absences (there need to be fewer than 2).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 10101
Output: 183236316
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 105```



## Solution

```Python3
class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [1,2,4,7]
        m = 10**9 + 7
        
        for i in range(4, n+1):
            dp.append((2 * dp[i-1] - dp[i-4])%m)
        
        r = dp[n]
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            r += (dp[i-1] * dp[n-i])

        return r %m
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
