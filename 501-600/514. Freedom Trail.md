## Problem

In the video game Fallout 4, the quest **"Road to Freedom"** requires players to reach a metal dial called the **"Freedom Trail Ring"** and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.

Given a string ```ring``` that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string ```key``` that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return **the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword**.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the ```"12:00"``` direction. You should spell all the characters in ```key``` one by one by rotating ```ring``` clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the ```"12:00"``` direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character ```key[i]```:


	
- You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as **one step**. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ```ring```'s characters at the ```"12:00"``` direction, where this character must equal ```key[i]```.
	
- If the character ```key[i]``` has been aligned at the ```"12:00"``` direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as **one step**. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.


 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/ring.jpg)

```
Input: ring = "godding", key = "gd"
Output: 4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring "godding" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become "ddinggo".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ring = "godding", key = "godding"
Output: 13
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100```
	
- ```ring``` and ```key``` consist of only lower case English letters.
	
- It is guaranteed that ```key``` could always be spelled by rotating ```ring```.



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findRotateSteps(String ring, String key) {
        HashMap<Character, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<Character, List<Integer>>();
        for (int i = 0; i < ring.length(); i ++) {
            char c = ring.charAt(i);
            if (!map.containsKey(c)) {
                map.put(c, new LinkedList<Integer>());
            }
            map.get(c).add(i);
        }
        ArrayList<Integer> poss = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        ArrayList<Integer> ways = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        poss.add(0);
        ways.add(0);
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < key.length(); i ++) {
            char c = key.charAt(i);
            ArrayList<Integer> newposs = new ArrayList<Integer>();
            ArrayList<Integer> newways = new ArrayList<Integer>();
            res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (Integer newpos:map.get(c)) {
                int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int j = 0; j < poss.size(); j ++) {
                    min = Math.min(min, getMin(newpos, poss.get(j), ring.length()) +  ways.get(j));
                }
                min ++;
                newposs.add(newpos);
                newways.add(min);
                res = Math.min(res, min);
            }
            poss = newposs;
            ways = newways;
        }
        return res;
    }
    private int getMin(int i, int j, int n) {
        int a = Math.min(i, j);
        int b = Math.max(i, j);
        return Math.min(b - a, n - b + a);
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
