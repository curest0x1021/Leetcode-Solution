## Problem

Your friend is typing his ```name``` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character ```c```, the key might get **long pressed**, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the ```typed``` characters of the keyboard. Return ```True``` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= name.length, typed.length <= 1000```
	
- ```name``` and ```typed``` consist of only lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isLongPressedName(String name, String typed) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        char prev = '$';
        if (typed.length() < name.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        while (i < name.length() && j < typed.length()) {
            while (j < typed.length() && typed.charAt(j) != name.charAt(i)) {
                if (typed.charAt(j) != prev) {
                    return false;
                }
                if (j == typed.length() - 1) {
                    return false;
                }
                j++;
            }
            prev = name.charAt(i);
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        if (i < name.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        for (; j < typed.length(); j++) {
            if (typed.charAt(j) != prev) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
