## Problem

The **width** of a sequence is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sequence.

Given an array of integers ```nums```, return **the sum of the **widths** of all the non-empty **subsequences** of **```nums```. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** ```109 + 7```.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, ```[3,6,2,7]``` is a subsequence of the array ```[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,1,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2,1], [2,3], [1,3], [2,1,3].
The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.
The sum of these widths is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2]
Output: 0
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 105```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int sumSubseqWidths(int[] nums) {
        int mod = 1_000_000_007;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int l = nums.length;
        long[] pow = new long[l];
        pow[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < l; i++) {
            pow[i] = pow[i - 1] * 2 % mod;
        }
        long res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < l; i++) {
            res = (res + (-1) * nums[i] * (pow[l - 1 - i] - 1) + nums[i] * (pow[i] - 1)) % mod;
        }
        return (int) res;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
