## Problem

Given the ```root``` of a binary tree, determine if it is a **complete binary tree**.

In a **complete binary tree**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between ```1``` and ```2h``` nodes inclusive at the last level ```h```.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-1.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range ```[1, 100]```.
	
- ```1 <= Node.val <= 1000```



## Solution (Java)

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isCompleteTree(TreeNode root) {
        /* 1. Tree no exist? complete! */
        if (root == null) {
            return true;
        }
        /* 2. Create a queue for purposeful sequence of inserting children nodes
        //   (Left to right, level by level)  */
        LinkedList<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root.left);
        queue.add(root.right);
        /* 3. Essential for our loop. Checks if we seen a null. */
        boolean seenNull = false;
        /* 4. While the queue isn't empty.
        //   Catch that null, and if there is a # after, it's not complete */
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode node = queue.poll();
            if (node == null) {
                seenNull = true;
            } else {
                if (seenNull) {
                    return false;
                }
                queue.add(node.left);
                queue.add(node.right);
            }
        }
        /*5. If we don't catch null with # after: it's complete */
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
