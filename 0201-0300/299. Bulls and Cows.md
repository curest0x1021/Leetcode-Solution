## Problem

You are playing the **Bulls and Cows** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:


	
- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
	
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.


Given the secret number ```secret``` and your friend's guess ```guess```, return **the hint for your friend's guess**.

The hint should be formatted as ```"xAyB"```, where ```x``` is the number of bulls and ```y``` is the number of cows. Note that both ```secret``` and ```guess``` may contain duplicate digits.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000```
	
- ```secret.length == guess.length```
	
- ```secret``` and ```guess``` consist of digits only.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
        final int[] ans = new int[10];
        int bulls = 0;
        int cows = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < secret.length(); i++) {
            final int s = Character.getNumericValue(secret.charAt(i));
            final int g = Character.getNumericValue(guess.charAt(i));
            if (s == g) {
                bulls++;
            } else {
                // digit s was already seen in guess, is being seen again in secret
                if (ans[s] < 0) {
                    cows++;
                }
                // digit was already seen in secret, now being seen again in guess
                if (ans[g] > 0) {
                    cows++;
                }
                ans[s]++;
                ans[g]--;
            }
        }
        return bulls + "A" + cows + "B";
    }
}
```

nope.

**Complexity:**

## Solution (Javascript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} secret
 * @param {string} guess
 * @return {string}
 */
var getHint = function(secret, guess) {
    var len = secret.length;
    var bull = 0;
    var cow = 0;
    var i;
    var secretArr = secret.split("").map(function(e) { return Number.parseInt(e); });
    var guessArr = guess.split("").map(function(e) { return Number.parseInt(e); });

    for(i = 0; i < len;){
        if(secretArr[i] === guessArr[i]){
            bull += 1;
            secretArr.splice(i, 1);
            guessArr.splice(i, 1);
            len--;
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }
    
    for(i = 0; i < guessArr.length; i++){
        if(secretArr.indexOf(guessArr[i]) > -1){
            cow++;
            secretArr.splice(secretArr.indexOf(guessArr[i]), 1);
        }
    }
    
    return bull+'A'+cow+'B';
};
```
