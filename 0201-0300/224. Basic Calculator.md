## Problem

Given a string ```s``` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return **the result of the evaluation**.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as ```eval()```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105```
	
- ```s``` consists of digits, ```'+'```, ```'-'```, ```'('```, ```')'```, and ```' '```.
	
- ```s``` represents a valid expression.
	
- ```'+'``` is **not** used as a unary operation (i.e., ```"+1"``` and ```"+(2 + 3)"``` is invalid).
	
- ```'-'``` could be used as a unary operation (i.e., ```"-1"``` and ```"-(2 + 3)"``` is valid).
	
- There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
	
- Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var calculate = function(s) {
  let stack = []
  let num = 0
  let sign = 1
  let res = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    let char = s.charAt(i)
    if (char >= '0' && char <= '9') {
      num = num * 10 + parseInt(char, 10)
    } else if (char === '+') {
      res += sign * num
      sign = 1
      num = 0
    } else if (char === '-') {
      res += sign * num
      sign = -1
      num = 0
    } else if (char === '(') {
      stack.push(res)
      stack.push(sign)
      sign = 1
      res = 0
      num = 0
    } else if (char === ')') {
      res += sign * num
      res *= stack.pop()
      res += stack.pop()
      num = 0
    }
  }
  return res + sign * num
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
