## Problem

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes ```p``` and ```q``` as the lowest node in ```T``` that has both ```p``` and ```q``` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range ```[2, 105]```.
	
- ```-109 <= Node.val <= 109```
	
- All ```Node.val``` are **unique**.
	
- ```p != q```
	
- ```p``` and ```q``` will exist in the BST.


## Solution (Java)
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        while (true) {
            if (root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val) {
                root = root.left;
            } else if (root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val) {
                root = root.right;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

## Solution (Javascript)

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
  const low = Math.min(p.val, q.val)
  const high = Math.max(p.val, q.val)
  let ancestor = null
  const aux = (node) => {
    if (!node) {
      return
    }
    if (node.val >= low && node.val <= high) {
      ancestor = node
    } else if (node.val <= low) {
      aux(node.right)
    } else {
      aux(node.left)
    }
  }
  aux(root)
  return ancestor
};
```

**Explain:**
