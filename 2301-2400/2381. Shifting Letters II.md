## Problem

You are given a string ```s``` of lowercase English letters and a 2D integer array ```shifts``` where ```shifts[i] = [starti, endi, directioni]```. For every ```i```, **shift** the characters in ```s``` from the index ```starti``` to the index ```endi``` (**inclusive**) forward if ```directioni = 1```, or shift the characters backward if ```directioni = 0```.

Shifting a character **forward** means replacing it with the **next** letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that ```'z'``` becomes ```'a'```). Similarly, shifting a character **backward** means replacing it with the **previous** letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that ```'a'``` becomes ```'z'```).

Return **the final string after all such shifts to **```s```** are applied**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc", shifts = [[0,1,0],[1,2,1],[0,2,1]]
Output: "ace"
Explanation: Firstly, shift the characters from index 0 to index 1 backward. Now s = "zac".
Secondly, shift the characters from index 1 to index 2 forward. Now s = "zbd".
Finally, shift the characters from index 0 to index 2 forward. Now s = "ace".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "dztz", shifts = [[0,0,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: "catz"
Explanation: Firstly, shift the characters from index 0 to index 0 backward. Now s = "cztz".
Finally, shift the characters from index 1 to index 1 forward. Now s = "catz".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length, shifts.length <= 5 * 10^4```
	
- ```shifts[i].length == 3```
	
- ```0 <= starti <= endi < s.length```
	
- ```0 <= directioni <= 1```
	
- ```s``` consists of lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public String shiftingLetters(String s, int[][] shifts) {
        int[] diff = new int[s.length() + 1];
        int l;
        int r;
        for (int[] shift : shifts) {
            l = shift[0];
            r = shift[1] + 1;
            diff[l] += 26;
            diff[r] += 26;
            if (shift[2] == 0) {
                diff[l]--;
                diff[r]++;
            } else {
                diff[l]++;
                diff[r]--;
            }
            diff[l] %= 26;
            diff[r] %= 26;
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int current = 0;
        int val;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            current += diff[i];
            val = s.charAt(i) - 'a';
            val += current;
            val %= 26;
            sb.append((char) ('a' + val));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
