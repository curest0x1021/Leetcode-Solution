## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** string ```blocks``` of length ```n```, where ```blocks[i]``` is either ```'W'``` or ```'B'```, representing the color of the ```ith``` block. The characters ```'W'``` and ```'B'``` denote the colors white and black, respectively.

You are also given an integer ```k```, which is the desired number of **consecutive** black blocks.

In one operation, you can **recolor** a white block such that it becomes a black block.

Return** the **minimum** number of operations needed such that there is at least **one** occurrence of **```k```** consecutive black blocks.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
Output: 3
Explanation:
One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
Therefore, we return 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.
Therefore, we return 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == blocks.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 100```
	
- ```blocks[i]``` is either ```'W'``` or ```'B'```.
	
- ```1 <= k <= n```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumRecolors(String blocks, int k) {
        int n = blocks.length();
        int ans;
        int i;
        int cur = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (blocks.charAt(i) == 'W') {
                cur++;
            }
        }
        ans = cur;
        for (i = k; i < n; i++) {
            if (blocks.charAt(i) == 'W') {
                cur++;
            }
            if (blocks.charAt(i - k) == 'W') {
                cur--;
            }
            ans = Math.min(ans, cur);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
