## Problem

You have ```n``` robots. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays, ```chargeTimes``` and ```runningCosts```, both of length ```n```. The ```ith``` robot costs ```chargeTimes[i]``` units to charge and costs ```runningCosts[i]``` units to run. You are also given an integer ```budget```.

The **total cost** of running ```k``` chosen robots is equal to ```max(chargeTimes) + k * sum(runningCosts)```, where ```max(chargeTimes)``` is the largest charge cost among the ```k``` robots and ```sum(runningCosts)``` is the sum of running costs among the ```k``` robots.

Return** the **maximum** number of **consecutive** robots you can run such that the total cost **does not** exceed **```budget```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: chargeTimes = [3,6,1,3,4], runningCosts = [2,1,3,4,5], budget = 25
Output: 3
Explanation: 
It is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.
To obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 * sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 which is less than 25.
It can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: chargeTimes = [11,12,19], runningCosts = [10,8,7], budget = 19
Output: 0
Explanation: No robot can be run that does not exceed the budget, so we return 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```chargeTimes.length == runningCosts.length == n```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 5 * 104```
	
- ```1 <= chargeTimes[i], runningCosts[i] <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= budget <= 1015```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumRobots(int[] times, int[] costs, long budget) {
        long sum = 0;
        int i = 0, n = times.length;
        Deque<Integer> d = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            sum += costs[j];
            while (!d.isEmpty() && times[d.peekLast()] <= times[j])
                d.pollLast();
            d.addLast(j);
            if (times[d.getFirst()] + (j - i + 1) * sum > budget) {
                if (d.getFirst() == i)
                    d.pollFirst();
                sum -= costs[i++];
            }
        }
        return n - i;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
