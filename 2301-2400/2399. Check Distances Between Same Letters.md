## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** string ```s``` consisting of only lowercase English letters, where each letter in ```s``` appears **exactly** **twice**. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array ```distance``` of length ```26```.

Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from ```0``` to ```25``` (i.e. ```'a' -> 0```, ```'b' -> 1```, ```'c' -> 2```, ... , ```'z' -> 25```).

In a **well-spaced** string, the number of letters between the two occurrences of the ```ith``` letter is ```distance[i]```. If the ```ith``` letter does not appear in ```s```, then ```distance[i]``` can be **ignored**.

Return ```true```** if **```s```** is a **well-spaced** string, otherwise return **```false```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abaccb", distance = [1,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 2 so it satisfies distance[0] = 1.
- 'b' appears at indices 1 and 5 so it satisfies distance[1] = 3.
- 'c' appears at indices 3 and 4 so it satisfies distance[2] = 0.
Note that distance[3] = 5, but since 'd' does not appear in s, it can be ignored.
Return true because s is a well-spaced string.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aa", distance = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: false
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 1 so there are zero letters between them.
Because distance[0] = 1, s is not a well-spaced string.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= s.length <= 52```
	
- ```s``` consists only of lowercase English letters.
	
- Each letter appears in ```s``` exactly twice.
	
- ```distance.length == 26```
	
- ```0 <= distance[i] <= 50```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkDistances(String s, int[] distance) {
        
        boolean valid = true;
        
        HashMap<Character,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int n = s.length();
        
        // System.out.println('c'-'a');
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
            
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if(map.containsKey(c)){
                int value = i - map.get(c) - 1;
                if(value != distance[c-'a'])return false;
            }else{
                map.put(c,i);
            }
        }
        
        return valid;
    }
}
```
