## Problem

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays ```nums``` and ```removeQueries```, both of length ```n```. For the ```ith``` query, the element in ```nums``` at the index ```removeQueries[i]``` is removed, splitting ```nums``` into different segments.

A **segment** is a contiguous sequence of **positive** integers in ```nums```. A **segment sum** is the sum of every element in a segment.

Return** an integer array **```answer```**, of length **```n```**, where **```answer[i]```** is the **maximum** segment sum after applying the **```ith``` **removal.**

**Note:** The same index will **not** be removed more than once.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]
Output: [14,7,2,2,0]
Explanation: Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
Query 1: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,2,5,6,1] and the maximum segment sum is 14 for segment [2,5,6,1].
Query 2: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [0,2,5,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 7 for segment [2,5].
Query 3: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
Query 4: Remove the 4th element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
Query 5: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
Finally, we return [14,7,2,2,0].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,11,1], removeQueries = [3,2,1,0]
Output: [16,5,3,0]
Explanation: Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
Query 1: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [3,2,11,0] and the maximum segment sum is 16 for segment [3,2,11].
Query 2: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [3,2,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 5 for segment [3,2].
Query 3: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [3,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 3 for segment [3].
Query 4: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.
Finally, we return [16,5,3,0].
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == nums.length == removeQueries.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 109```
	
- ```0 <= removeQueries[i] < n```
	
- All the values of ```removeQueries``` are **unique**.



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    private static class UF {
        int[] root;
        long[] sum;

        public UF(int n) {
            this.root = new int[n];
            Arrays.fill(this.root, -1);
            this.sum = new long[n];
        }

        public void insert(int x, int value) {
            if (root[x] != -1 || sum[x] != 0) {
                return;
            }
            this.root[x] = x;
            this.sum[x] = value;
        }

        public int find(int x) {
            while (root[x] != x) {
                int fa = root[x];
                int ga = root[fa];
                root[x] = ga;
                x = fa;
            }
            return x;
        }

        public void union(int x, int y) {
            int rx = find(x);
            int ry = find(y);
            if (x == y) {
                return;
            }
            root[rx] = ry;
            sum[ry] += sum[rx];
        }

        public boolean has(int x) {
            return root[x] != -1 || sum[x] != 0;
        }
    }

    public long[] maximumSegmentSum(int[] nums, int[] removeQueries) {
        int n = removeQueries.length;
        long[] ret = new long[n];
        long max = 0L;
        UF uf = new UF(n);
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int u = removeQueries[i];
            uf.insert(u, nums[u]);
            for (int v = u - 1; v <= u + 1; v += 2) {
                if (v >= 0 && v < n && uf.has(v)) {
                    uf.union(v, u);
                }
            }
            ret[i] = max;
            int ru = uf.find(u);
            max = Math.max(max, uf.sum[ru]);
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```
