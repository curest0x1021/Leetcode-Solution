## Problem

You are given two **positive** integers ```startPos``` and ```endPos```. Initially, you are standing at position ```startPos``` on an **infinite** number line. With one step, you can move either one position to the left, or one position to the right.

Given a positive integer ```k```, return **the number of **different** ways to reach the position **```endPos```** starting from **```startPos```**, such that you perform **exactly** **```k```** steps**. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** ```10^9 + 7```.

Two ways are considered different if the order of the steps made is not exactly the same.

**Note** that the number line includes negative integers.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: startPos = 1, endPos = 2, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: We can reach position 2 from 1 in exactly 3 steps in three ways:
- 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2.
- 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2.
- 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2.
It can be proven that no other way is possible, so we return 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: startPos = 2, endPos = 5, k = 10
Output: 0
Explanation: It is impossible to reach position 5 from position 2 in exactly 10 steps.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= startPos, endPos, k <= 1000```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    int p = 1000000007;
    public int numberOfWays(int a, int b, int k) {
        if ((a - b - k) % 2 != 0) return 0;
        if (Math.abs(a - b) > k) return 0;
        long res = 1L;
        for (int i = 0; i < (b - a + k) / 2; ++i) {
            res = res * (k - i) % p;
            res = res * inv(i + 1) % p;
        }
        return (int)res;
    }

    private long inv(long a) {
        if (a == 1) return 1;
        return (p - p / a) * inv(p % a) % p;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
