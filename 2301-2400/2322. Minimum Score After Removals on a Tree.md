## Problem

There is an undirected connected tree with ```n``` nodes labeled from ```0``` to ```n - 1``` and ```n - 1``` edges.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array ```nums``` of length ```n``` where ```nums[i]``` represents the value of the ```ith``` node. You are also given a 2D integer array ```edges``` of length ```n - 1``` where ```edges[i] = [ai, bi]``` indicates that there is an edge between nodes ```ai``` and ```bi``` in the tree.

Remove two **distinct** edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:


	
- Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for **each** of the three components respectively.
	
- The **difference** between the **largest** XOR value and the **smallest** XOR value is the **score** of the pair.



	
- For example, say the three components have the node values: ```[4,5,7]```, ```[1,9]```, and ```[3,3,3]```. The three XOR values are ```4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = **6**```, ```1 ^ 9 = **8**```, and ```3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = **3**```. The largest XOR value is ```8``` and the smallest XOR value is ```3```. The score is then ```8 - 3 = 5```.


Return **the **minimum** score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree**.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/03/ex1drawio.png)

```
Input: nums = [1,5,5,4,11], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
Output: 9
Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes [1,3,4] with values [5,4,11]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.
- The 2nd component has node [0] with value [1]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
- The 3rd component has node [2] with value [5]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/05/03/ex2drawio.png)

```
Input: nums = [5,5,2,4,4,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[5,2],[4,3],[1,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes [3,4] with values [4,4]. Its XOR value is 4 ^ 4 = 0.
- The 2nd component has nodes [1,0] with values [5,5]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 5 = 0.
- The 3rd component has nodes [2,5] with values [2,2]. Its XOR value is 2 ^ 2 = 0.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 0 - 0 = 0.
We cannot obtain a smaller score than 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == nums.length```
	
- ```3 <= n <= 1000```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 10^8```
	
- ```edges.length == n - 1```
	
- ```edges[i].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= ai, bi < n```
	
- ```ai != bi```
	
- ```edges``` represents a valid tree.



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    private int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    // function to travel 2nd time on the tree and find the second edge to be removed
    private int helper(
            int src, ArrayList<Integer>[] graph, int[] arr, int par, int block, int xor1, int tot) {
        // Setting the value for the current subtree's XOR value
        int myXOR = arr[src];
        for (int nbr : graph[src]) {
            // If the current nbr is niether the parent of this node nor the blocked node  , then
            // only we'll proceed
            if (nbr != par && nbr != block) {
                int nbrXOR = helper(nbr, graph, arr, src, block, xor1, tot);
                // 'src <----> nbr' is the second edge to be removed
                // Getting the XOR value of the current neighbor
                int xor2 = nbrXOR;
                // The XOR of the remaining component
                int xor3 = (tot ^ xor1) ^ xor2;
                // Getting the minimum of the three values
                int max = Math.max(xor1, Math.max(xor2, xor3));
                // Getting the maximum of the three value
                int min = Math.min(xor1, Math.min(xor2, xor3));

        return myXOR;
    }

    // function to travel 1st time on the tree and find the first edge to be removed and
    // then block the node at which the edge ends to avoid selecting the same node again
    private int dfs(int src, ArrayList<Integer>[] graph, int[] arr, int par, int tot) {

            if (nbr != par) {
                // After selecting 'src <----> nbr' as the first edge, we block 'nbr' node and then
                // make a call to try all the second edges
                int nbrXOR = dfs(nbr, graph, arr, src, tot);
                // Calling the helper to find the try all the second edges after blocking the
                // current node
                helper(0, graph, arr, -1, nbr, nbrXOR, tot);
                // Including the neighbour subtree's XOR value in the XOR value of the subtree
                // rooted at src node
                myXOR ^= nbrXOR;
            }
        }
        // Returing the XOR value of the current subtree rooted at the src node
        return myXOR;
    }

    public int minimumScore(int[] arr, int[][] edges) {
        int n = arr.length;
        ArrayList<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        int tot = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Initializing the graph and finding the total XOR
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
            tot ^= arr[i];
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            // adding the edges
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            graph[u].add(v);
            graph[v].add(u);

        ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        dfs(0, graph, arr, -1, tot);
