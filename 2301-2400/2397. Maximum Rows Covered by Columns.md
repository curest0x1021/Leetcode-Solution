## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** ```m x n``` binary matrix ```matrix``` and an integer ```numSelect```, which denotes the number of **distinct** columns you must select from ```matrix```.

Let us consider ```s = {c1, c2, ...., cnumSelect}``` as the set of columns selected by you. A row ```row``` is **covered** by ```s``` if:


	
- For each cell ```matrix[row][col]``` (```0 <= col <= n - 1```) where ```matrix[row][col] == 1```, ```col``` is present in ```s``` or,
	
- **No cell** in ```row``` has a value of ```1```.


You need to choose ```numSelect``` columns such that the number of rows that are covered is **maximized**.

Return **the **maximum** number of rows that can be **covered** by a set of **```numSelect```** columns.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]], numSelect = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above.
We choose s = {0, 2}.
- Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1.
- Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s.
- Row 2 is not covered because matrix[2][1] == 1 but 1 is not present in s.
- Row 3 is covered because matrix[2][2] == 1 and 2 is present in s.
Thus, we can cover three rows.
Note that s = {1, 2} will also cover 3 rows, but it can be shown that no more than three rows can be covered.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/07/14/rowscovered2.png)

```
Input: matrix = [[1],[0]], numSelect = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Selecting the only column will result in both rows being covered since the entire matrix is selected.
Therefore, we return 2.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```m == matrix.length```
	
- ```n == matrix[i].length```
	
- ```1 <= m, n <= 12```
	
- ```matrix[i][j]``` is either ```0``` or ```1```.
	
- ```1 <= numSelect <= n```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumRows(int[][] mat, int cols) {
        
        int m=mat.length;
        int n=mat[0].length;
        
        int[] s=new int[n];
        
        return f(0,m,n,cols,mat,s);
    }
    
    public int f(int ind,int m,int n,int cols,int[][] mat,int[] s){
        
        if(cols==0){
            int count=0;
            for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
			//supposing that this row is valid
                boolean selected=true;
                for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
				//if any cell of this row violates the given two conditions, then the row is discarded
                    if(mat[i][j]==1 && s[j]!=1)
                        selected=false;
                }
                if(selected)
                    count+=1;
            }
            
            return count;
        }
        
        int ans=-1;
        for(int i=ind; i<n; i++){
            
            s[i]=1; //do
            ans=Math.max(ans,f(i+1,m,n,cols-1,mat,s));
            s[i]=0; //undo / backtrack
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
