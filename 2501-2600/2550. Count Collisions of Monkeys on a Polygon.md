## Problem

There is a regular convex polygon with ```n``` vertices. The vertices are labeled from ```0``` to ```n - 1``` in a clockwise direction, and each vertex has **exactly one monkey**. The following figure shows a convex polygon of ```6``` vertices.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/22/hexagon.jpg)

Each monkey moves simultaneously to a neighboring vertex. A neighboring vertex for a vertex ```i``` can be:


	
- the vertex ```(i + 1) % n``` in the clockwise direction, or
	
- the vertex ```(i - 1 + n) % n``` in the counter-clockwise direction.


A **collision** happens if at least two monkeys reside on the same vertex after the movement.

Return **the number of ways the monkeys can move so that at least **one collision**** ** happens**. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo ```109 + 7```.

**Note** that each monkey can only move once.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 8 total possible movements.
Two ways such that they collide at some point are:
- Monkey 1 moves in a clockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 2 collide.
- Monkey 1 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 3 collide.
It can be shown 6 total movements result in a collision.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: It can be shown that there are 14 ways for the monkeys to collide.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```3 <= n <= 109```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    long mod = 1000000007;
    public int monkeyMove(int n) {
        return (int)((mod + calcPow(2, n) - 2)%mod);
    }
    
    long calcPow(long num, long pow){
        long res = 1l;
        while(pow > 0){
            if((pow&1) == 1){
                res = (res*num)%mod;
            }
            pow >>= 1;
            num = (num*num)%mod;
        }
        
        return (res)%mod;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
