## Problem

Given a positive integer `num`, split it into two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` such that:

    The concatenation of ```num1``` and ```num2``` is a permutation of ```num```.




- In other words, the sum of the number of occurrences of each digit in `num1` and `num2` is equal to the number of occurrences of that digit in `num`.
- `num1` and `num2` can contain leading zeros.

Return **the **minimum** possible sum of** `num1` **and** `num2`.

**Notes:**

- It is guaranteed that `num` does not contain any leading zeros.
- The order of occurrence of the digits in `num1` and `num2` may differ from the order of occurrence of `num`.

Example 1:

```
Input: num = 4325
Output: 59
Explanation: We can split 4325 so that num1 is 24 and num2 is 35, giving a sum of 59. We can prove that 59 is indeed the minimal possible sum.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: num = 687
Output: 75
Explanation: We can split 687 so that num1 is 68 and num2 is 7, which would give an optimal sum of 75.
```

**Constraints:**

- `10 <= num <= 109`

## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int splitNum(int num) {
        char arr[] = String.valueOf(num).toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        String n1 = "", n2 = "";
        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i+=2){
            if(i<arr.length)    n1 += arr[i]+"";
            if(i+1<arr.length)  n2 += arr[i+1]+"";
        }
        return Integer.parseInt(n1)+Integer.parseInt(n2);
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

- Time complexity : O(n).
- Space complexity : O(n).
