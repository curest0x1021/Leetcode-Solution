## Problem

You are given a string ```s``` consisting of digits from ```1``` to ```9``` and an integer ```k```.

A partition of a string ```s``` is called **good** if:


	
- Each digit of ```s``` is part of **exactly** one substring.
	
- The value of each substring is less than or equal to ```k```.


Return **the **minimum** number of substrings in a **good** partition of** ```s```. If no **good** partition of ```s``` exists, return ```-1```.

**Note** that:


	
- The **value** of a string is its result when interpreted as an integer. For example, the value of ```"123"``` is ```123``` and the value of ```"1"``` is ```1```.
	
- A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.


 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "165462", k = 60
Output: 4
Explanation: We can partition the string into substrings "16", "54", "6", and "2". Each substring has a value less than or equal to k = 60.
It can be shown that we cannot partition the string into less than 4 substrings.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "238182", k = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no good partition for this string.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 105```
	
- ```s[i]``` is a digit from ```'1'``` to ```'9'```.
	
- ```1 <= k <= 109```

}
.spoiler {overflow:hidden;}
.spoiler > div {-webkit-transition: all 0s ease;-moz-transition: margin 0s ease;-o-transition: all 0s ease;transition: margin 0s ease;}
.spoilerbutton[value="Show Message"] + .spoiler > div {margin-top:-500%;}
.spoilerbutton[value="Hide Message"] + .spoiler {padding:5px;}



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumPartition(String s, int k) {
        int left = 0, right = 1, len = s.length(), count = 0;
        for(right=1;right<=len;right++){
		//Max value of k is 10^9, thus we check if window size is greater than 9, its value 
		//will be surely greater than k as only digits from 1-9 are allowed.
            if(right-left>9 || Integer.parseInt(s.substring(left, right))>k){
                if(Integer.parseInt(s.substring(right-1, right))>k) return -1;
                else{
                    left = right-1; count++;
                }
            }
        }
        if(left<right) count++;
        return count;
    }
}
```
