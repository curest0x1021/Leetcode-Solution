## Problem

You are given two string arrays ```positive_feedback``` and ```negative_feedback```, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that **no** word is both positive and negative.

Initially every student has ```0``` points. Each positive word in a feedback report **increases** the points of a student by ```3```, whereas each negative word **decreases** the points by ```1```.

You are given ```n``` feedback reports, represented by a **0-indexed** string array ```report``` and a **0-indexed** integer array ```student_id```, where ```student_id[i]``` represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report ```report[i]```. The ID of each student is **unique**.

Given an integer ```k```, return **the top **```k```** students after ranking them in **non-increasing** order by their points**. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: positive_feedback = ["smart","brilliant","studious"], negative_feedback = ["not"], report = ["this student is studious","the student is smart"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: 
Both the students have 1 positive feedback and 3 points but since student 1 has a lower ID he ranks higher.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: positive_feedback = ["smart","brilliant","studious"], negative_feedback = ["not"], report = ["this student is not studious","the student is smart"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: 
- The student with ID 1 has 1 positive feedback and 1 negative feedback, so he has 3-1=2 points. 
- The student with ID 2 has 1 positive feedback, so he has 3 points. 
Since student 2 has more points, [2,1] is returned.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= positive_feedback.length, negative_feedback.length <= 104```
	
- ```1 <= positive_feedback[i].length, negative_feedback[j].length <= 100```
	
- Both ```positive_feedback[i]``` and ```negative_feedback[j]``` consists of lowercase English letters.
	
- No word is present in both ```positive_feedback``` and ```negative_feedback```.
	
- ```n == report.length == student_id.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 104```
	
- ```report[i]``` consists of lowercase English letters and spaces ```' '```.
	
- There is a single space between consecutive words of ```report[i]```.
	
- ```1 <= report[i].length <= 100```
	
- ```1 <= student_id[i] <= 109```
	
- All the values of ```student_id[i]``` are **unique**.
	
- ```1 <= k <= n```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> topStudents(String[] positive_feedback, String[] negative_feedback, String[] report, int[] student_id, int k) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        Set<String> pos = new HashSet<>(List.of(positive_feedback));
        Set<String> neg = new HashSet<>(List.of(negative_feedback));
        int n = report.length;
        int[][] rank = new int[n][2];
        // System.out.println(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String rep = report[i];
            rank[i][0]=student_id[i];
            String[] strs=rep.split(" ");
            for(String s:strs){
                if(pos.contains(s)){
                    rank[i][1]+=3;
                }
                if(neg.contains(s)){
                    rank[i][1]-=1;
                }
            }
        }
        Arrays.sort(rank,(a,b)->{
            if(a[1]==b[1]){
                return a[0]-b[0];
            }
            return b[1]-a[1];
        });

        for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
            res.add(rank[i][0]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
