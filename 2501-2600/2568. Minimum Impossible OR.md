## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array ```nums```.

We say that an integer x is **expressible** from ```nums``` if there exist some integers ```0 <= index1 < index2 < ... < indexk < nums.length``` for which ```nums[index1] | nums[index2] | ... | nums[indexk] = x```. In other words, an integer is expressible if it can be written as the bitwise OR of some subsequence of ```nums```.

Return **the minimum **positive non-zero integer** that is not ****expressible from **```nums```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: 1 and 2 are already present in the array. We know that 3 is expressible, since nums[0] | nums[1] = 2 | 1 = 3. Since 4 is not expressible, we return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,3,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can show that 1 is the smallest number that is not expressible.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 109```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minImpossibleOR(int[] A) {
        Set<Integer> s = new HashSet<>();
        for (int a : A)
            s.add(a);
        int a = 1;
        while (s.contains(a))
            a <<= 1;
        return a;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
