## Problem

You are given an integer array ```nums```. A subsequence of ```nums``` is called a **square streak** if:


	
- The length of the subsequence is at least ```2```, and
	
- **after** sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the **square** of the previous number.


Return** the length of the **longest square streak** in **```nums```**, or return **```-1```** if there is no **square streak**.**

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,3,6,16,8,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose the subsequence [4,16,2]. After sorting it, it becomes [2,4,16].
- 4 = 2 * 2.
- 16 = 4 * 4.
Therefore, [4,16,2] is a square streak.
It can be shown that every subsequence of length 4 is not a square streak.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,5,6,7]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no square streak in nums so return -1.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= nums.length <= 105```
	
- ```2 <= nums[i] <= 105```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSquareStreak(int[] nums) {
        Set<Long> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            set.add((long) nums[i]);
        }
        int maxCount = -1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= 10000; i++) {
            long value = i;
            int count = 0;
            while (value <= 10000000) {
                if (set.contains(value)) {
                    count++;
                } else {
                    maxCount = Math.max(count, maxCount);
                    count = 0;   
                }
                value = value * value;
            }
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
        }        
        if (maxCount <= 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        return maxCount;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
