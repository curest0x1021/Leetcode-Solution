## Problem

You have two fruit baskets containing ```n``` fruits each. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays ```basket1``` and ```basket2``` representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets **equal**. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:


	
- Chose two indices ```i``` and ```j```, and swap the ```ith ```fruit of ```basket1``` with the ```jth``` fruit of ```basket2```.
	
- The cost of the swap is ```min(basket1[i],basket2[j])```.


Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.

Return **the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or **```-1```** if impossible.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: basket1 = [4,2,2,2], basket2 = [1,4,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap index 1 of basket1 with index 0 of basket2, which has cost 1. Now basket1 = [4,1,2,2] and basket2 = [2,4,1,2]. Rearranging both the arrays makes them equal.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: basket1 = [2,3,4,1], basket2 = [3,2,5,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that it is impossible to make both the baskets equal.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```basket1.length == bakste2.length```
	
- ```1 <= basket1.length <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= basket1[i],basket2[i] <= 109```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public long minCost(int[] basket1, int[] basket2) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> cnt = new HashMap<>();
        for (int c: basket1) 
            cnt.put(c, cnt.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        for (int c: basket2) 
            cnt.put(c, cnt.getOrDefault(c, 0) - 1);
        List<Integer> last = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> e: cnt.entrySet()) {
            int v = e.getValue();
            // if v is odd, an even distribution is never possible
            if (v % 2 != 0) return -1;
            // the count of transferred k is |v|/2
            for (int i = 0; i < Math.abs(v) / 2; ++i)
                last.add(e.getKey());
        }
        // find the min of two input arrays as the intermediate
        int minx = Math.min(Arrays.stream(basket1).min().getAsInt(),
                            Arrays.stream(basket2).min().getAsInt());
        // Use quickselect instead of sort can get a better complexity
        Collections.sort(last);
        long res = 0;
        // The first half may be the cost
        for (int i = 0; i < last.size() / 2; ++i) 
            res += Math.min(last.get(i), minx * 2);
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
