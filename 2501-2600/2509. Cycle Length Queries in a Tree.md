## Problem

You are given an integer ```n```. There is a **complete binary tree** with ```2n - 1``` nodes. The root of that tree is the node with the value ```1```, and every node with a value ```val``` in the range ```[1, 2n - 1 - 1]``` has two children where:


	
- The left node has the value ```2 * val```, and
	
- The right node has the value ```2 * val + 1```.


You are also given a 2D integer array ```queries``` of length ```m```, where ```queries[i] = [ai, bi]```. For each query, solve the following problem:


	
- Add an edge between the nodes with values ```ai``` and ```bi```.
	
- Find the length of the cycle in the graph.
	
- Remove the added edge between nodes with values ```ai``` and ```bi```.


**Note** that:


	
- A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is visited only once.
	
- The length of a cycle is the number of edges visited in the cycle.
	
- There could be multiple edges between two nodes in the tree after adding the edge of the query.


Return **an array **```answer```** of length **```m```** where** ```answer[i]``` **is the answer to the** ```ith``` **query.**

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/25/bexample1.png)

```
Input: n = 3, queries = [[5,3],[4,7],[2,3]]
Output: [4,5,3]
Explanation: The diagrams above show the tree of 23 - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
- After adding the edge between nodes 3 and 5, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [5,2,1,3]. Thus answer to the first query is 4. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
- After adding the edge between nodes 4 and 7, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [4,2,1,3,7]. Thus answer to the second query is 5. We delete the added edge and process the next query.
- After adding the edge between nodes 2 and 3, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [2,1,3]. Thus answer to the third query is 3. We delete the added edge.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/25/aexample2.png)

```
Input: n = 2, queries = [[1,2]]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree of 22 - 1 nodes. Nodes colored in red describe the nodes in the cycle after adding the edge.
- After adding the edge between nodes 1 and 2, the graph contains a cycle of nodes [2,1]. Thus answer for the first query is 2. We delete the added edge.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= n <= 30```
	
- ```m == queries.length```
	
- ```1 <= m <= 105```
	
- ```queries[i].length == 2```
	
- ```1 <= ai, bi <= 2n - 1```
	
- ```ai != bi```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] cycleLengthQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        var res = new int[queries.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < res.length; i++) {
            var a = getRootPath(queries[i][0]);
            var b = getRootPath(queries[i][1]);
            while (a.size() > 0 && b.size() > 0 && a.get(a.size() - 1).equals(b.get(b.size() - 1))) {
                a.remove(a.size() - 1);
                b.remove(b.size() - 1);
            }
            res[i] = a.size() + b.size() + 1;
        }
        
        return res;
    }

    private List<Integer> getRootPath(int u) {
        var path = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        while (u != 0) {
            path.add(u);
            u /= 2;
        }
        return path;
    }
}
```
