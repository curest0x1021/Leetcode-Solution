## Problem

Given an array of positive integers ```nums```, return **the number of **distinct prime factors** in the product of the elements of** ```nums```.

**Note** that:


	
- A number greater than ```1``` is called **prime** if it is divisible by only ```1``` and itself.
	
- An integer ```val1``` is a factor of another integer ```val2``` if ```val2 / val1``` is an integer.


 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,3,7,10,6]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The product of all the elements in nums is: 2 * 4 * 3 * 7 * 10 * 6 = 10080 = 25 * 32 * 5 * 7.
There are 4 distinct prime factors so we return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,8,16]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The product of all the elements in nums is: 2 * 4 * 8 * 16 = 1024 = 210.
There is 1 distinct prime factor so we return 1.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 104```
	
- ```2 <= nums[i] <= 1000```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int distinctPrimeFactors(int[] nums) {
        int count=0;
        int[] a = new int[1001];
        //mark prime factors of all elements of nums using hashtable(a)
        for(int x:nums){
            primeFactors(x,a);
        }

        //counting all distinct prime factors
        for(int x:a){
            if(x==1)
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private void primeFactors(int x,int[] a)
    {
        int root = (int)Math.sqrt(x);
        for (int i=2; i<=root; i++) {
            while (x%i == 0) {
                x/=i;
                a[i]=1;
            }
        }

        if(x>=2)
            a[x]=1;
    }
    
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
