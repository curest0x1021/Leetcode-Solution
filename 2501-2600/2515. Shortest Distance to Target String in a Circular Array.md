## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** **circular** string array ```words``` and a string ```target```. A **circular array** means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.


	
- Formally, the next element of ```words[i]``` is ```words[(i + 1) % n]``` and the previous element of ```words[i]``` is ```words[(i - 1 + n) % n]```, where ```n``` is the length of ```words```.


Starting from ```startIndex```, you can move to either the next word or the previous word with ```1``` step at a time.

Return **the **shortest** distance needed to reach the string** ```target```. If the string ```target``` does not exist in ```words```, return ```-1```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["hello","i","am","leetcode","hello"], target = "hello", startIndex = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: We start from index 1 and can reach "hello" by
- moving 3 units to the right to reach index 4.
- moving 2 units to the left to reach index 4.
- moving 4 units to the right to reach index 0.
- moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 0.
The shortest distance to reach "hello" is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["a","b","leetcode"], target = "leetcode", startIndex = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: We start from index 0 and can reach "leetcode" by
- moving 2 units to the right to reach index 3.
- moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 3.
The shortest distance to reach "leetcode" is 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["i","eat","leetcode"], target = "ate", startIndex = 0
Output: -1
Explanation: Since "ate" does not exist in words, we return -1.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= words.length <= 100```
	
- ```1 <= words[i].length <= 100```
	
- ```words[i]``` and ```target``` consist of only lowercase English letters.
	
- ```0 <= startIndex < words.length```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int closetTarget(String[] words, String target, int startIndex) {
        int n = words.length;
        int ans = 10001, t = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (words[i].equals(target)) {
                int val = Math.abs(i - startIndex);
                t = 0;
                if (i > startIndex) {
                    t = startIndex + n - i;
                } else {
                    t = i + n - startIndex;
                }
                ans = Math.min(t, Math.min(val, ans));
            }
        }
        return ans == 10001 ? -1 : ans;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
