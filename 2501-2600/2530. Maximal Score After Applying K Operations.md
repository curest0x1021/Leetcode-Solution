## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array ```nums``` and an integer ```k```. You have a **starting score** of ```0```.

In one **operation**:


	
- choose an index ```i``` such that ```0 <= i < nums.length```,
	
- increase your **score** by ```nums[i]```, and
	
- replace ```nums[i]``` with ```ceil(nums[i] / 3)```.


Return **the maximum possible **score** you can attain after applying **exactly**** ```k``` **operations**.

The ceiling function ```ceil(val)``` is the least integer greater than or equal to ```val```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,10,10,10,10], k = 5
Output: 50
Explanation: Apply the operation to each array element exactly once. The final score is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,10,3,3,3], k = 3
Output: 17
Explanation: You can do the following operations:
Operation 1: Select i = 1, so nums becomes [1,4,3,3,3]. Your score increases by 10.
Operation 2: Select i = 1, so nums becomes [1,2,3,3,3]. Your score increases by 4.
Operation 3: Select i = 2, so nums becomes [1,1,1,3,3]. Your score increases by 3.
The final score is 10 + 4 + 3 = 17.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length, k <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 109```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    
    public long maxKelements(int[] arr, int k) {
        // Priorty Queue in reverse order is going to
        // give the highest number awailable
        PriorityQueue<Integer> queue = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        int n = arr.length;
        long answer = 0;

        // Add all the elements in priorty queue
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            queue.add(arr[i]);
        }

        //Loop k number of times as mentioned in question
        for(int i=0; i<k; i++){

        //Now grab the element from queue by poll function
        // (it will give highest awailable always)
            int temp = queue.poll();
            answer += temp;

        // After adding highest element in our answer
        // Give that number back to queue by doing the-
        //-operation as told in question ceil(num[i]/3)
            double s = (double)temp/3;
            queue.add((int)Math.ceil(s));
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
