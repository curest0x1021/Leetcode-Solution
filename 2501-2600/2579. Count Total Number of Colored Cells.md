## Problem

There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer `n`, indicating that you must do the following routine for `n` minutes:

- At the first minute, color **any** arbitrary unit cell blue.
- Every minute thereafter, color blue **every** uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.

Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/10/example-copy-2.png)

Return **the number of **colored cells** at the end of **`n` **minutes**.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: After 1 minute, there is only 1 blue cell, so we return 1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: After 2 minutes, there are 4 colored cells on the boundary and 1 in the center, so we return 5.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 105`

## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public long coloredCells(int n) {
        long sum=1L;
        if(n==1)return sum;
        for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
            sum+=(long)(4L*(long)(i-1));
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

- Time complexity : O(n).
- Space complexity : O(n).
