## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** ```m x n``` **binary** matrix ```grid```. You can move from a cell ```(row, col)``` to any of the cells ```(row + 1, col)``` or ```(row, col + 1)``` that has the value ```1```. The matrix is **disconnected** if there is no path from ```(0, 0)``` to ```(m - 1, n - 1)```.

You can flip the value of **at most one** (possibly none) cell. You **cannot flip** the cells ```(0, 0)``` and ```(m - 1, n - 1)```.

Return ```true``` **if it is possible to make the matrix disconnect or **```false```** otherwise**.

**Note** that flipping a cell changes its value from ```0``` to ```1``` or from ```1``` to ```0```.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/07/yetgrid2drawio.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can change the cell shown in the diagram above. There is no path from (0, 0) to (2, 2) in the resulting grid.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/07/yetgrid3drawio.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: It is not possible to change at most one cell such that there is not path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```m == grid.length```
	
- ```n == grid[i].length```
	
- ```1 <= m, n <= 1000```
	
- ```1 <= m * n <= 105```
	
- ```grid[i][j]``` is either ```0``` or ```1```.
	
- ```grid[0][0] == grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 1```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPossibleToCutPath(int[][] grid) {
        int first=dfs(grid,0,0);
        grid[0][0]=1; //reset for 2nd dfs() as got updated above
        int second=dfs(grid,0,0);
        return second >= 1 ? false : true;
    }
    
    private int dfs(int[][] g, int r, int c) {
        if(r == g.length-1 && c == g[0].length-1)
            return 1;
        if(r == g.length || c == g[0].length || g[r][c] == 0)
            return 0;
        
        g[r][c]=0;
        if(dfs(g,r+1,c) == 1)
            return 1;
        return dfs(g,r,c+1);
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
