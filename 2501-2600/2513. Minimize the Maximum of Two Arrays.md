## Problem

We have two arrays ```arr1``` and ```arr2``` which are initially empty. You need to add positive integers to them such that they satisfy all the following conditions:


	
- ```arr1``` contains ```uniqueCnt1``` **distinct** positive integers, each of which is **not divisible** by ```divisor1```.
	
- ```arr2``` contains ```uniqueCnt2``` **distinct** positive integers, each of which is **not divisible** by ```divisor2```.
	
- **No** integer is present in both ```arr1``` and ```arr2```.


Given ```divisor1```, ```divisor2```, ```uniqueCnt1```, and ```uniqueCnt2```, return **the **minimum possible maximum** integer that can be present in either array**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: divisor1 = 2, divisor2 = 7, uniqueCnt1 = 1, uniqueCnt2 = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: 
We can distribute the first 4 natural numbers into arr1 and arr2.
arr1 = [1] and arr2 = [2,3,4].
We can see that both arrays satisfy all the conditions.
Since the maximum value is 4, we return it.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: divisor1 = 3, divisor2 = 5, uniqueCnt1 = 2, uniqueCnt2 = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Here arr1 = [1,2], and arr2 = [3] satisfy all conditions.
Since the maximum value is 3, we return it.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: divisor1 = 2, divisor2 = 4, uniqueCnt1 = 8, uniqueCnt2 = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: 
Here, the final possible arrays can be arr1 = [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15], and arr2 = [2,6].
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a lower maximum satisfying all conditions. 
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= divisor1, divisor2 <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= uniqueCnt1, uniqueCnt2 < 109```
	
- ```2 <= uniqueCnt1 + uniqueCnt2 <= 109```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    static public long gcd(int a, int b) { return b==0 ? a : gcd(b, a%b); }
    public int minimizeSet(int divisor1, int divisor2, int uniqueCnt1, int uniqueCnt2) {
        long gcd=gcd(divisor1,divisor2), lcm=(long)divisor1*(long)divisor2/gcd;
        long divisible1=lcm/divisor1, divisible2=lcm/divisor2;
        long nondivisibleCommon = lcm - divisible1 - divisible2 + 1;
        long batches = (uniqueCnt1+uniqueCnt2)/(lcm-1), remainder = (uniqueCnt1+uniqueCnt2)%(lcm-1);
        long nondiv1=(divisible2-1)*batches, nondiv2=(divisible1-1)*batches, common=nondivisibleCommon*batches;
        nondiv1 += remainder/divisor2;
        nondiv2 += remainder/divisor1;
        common += (remainder-remainder/divisor1-remainder/divisor2);
        long answer = batches * lcm + remainder;
        if (nondiv1<=uniqueCnt1 && nondiv2<=uniqueCnt2) {
            return remainder==0 ? (int)answer - 1 : (int) answer;
        } else {
            long nondiv = nondiv1 >= uniqueCnt1 ? nondiv2 : nondiv1;
            long cnt = nondiv1 >= uniqueCnt1 ? uniqueCnt2 : uniqueCnt1;
            long divisor = nondiv1 >= uniqueCnt1 ? divisor2 : divisor1;
            long remain = cnt - nondiv - common;
            answer += remain/(divisor-1)*divisor;
            remain %= divisor-1;
            if (remain==0) {
                return  answer%divisor==0 ? (int)answer-1: (int)answer;
            } else if (answer%divisor + remain >= divisor) {
                return (int)answer + (int)remain + 1;
            } else {
                return (int)answer + (int)remain;
            }
        }
    }
}
