## Problem

We define the `lcp` matrix of any **0-indexed** string `word` of `n` lowercase English letters as an `n x n` grid such that:

- `lcp[i][j]` is equal to the length of the **longest common prefix** between the substrings `word[i,n-1]` and `word[j,n-1]`.

Given an `n x n` matrix `lcp`, return the alphabetically smallest string `word` that corresponds to `lcp`. If there is no such string, return an empty string.

A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`. For example, `"aabd"` is lexicographically smaller than `"aaca"` because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and `'b'` comes before `'c'`.

Example 1:

```
Input: lcp = [[4,0,2,0],[0,3,0,1],[2,0,2,0],[0,1,0,1]]
Output: "abab"
Explanation: lcp corresponds to any 4 letter string with two alternating letters. The lexicographically smallest of them is "abab".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: lcp = [[4,3,2,1],[3,3,2,1],[2,2,2,1],[1,1,1,1]]
Output: "aaaa"
Explanation: lcp corresponds to any 4 letter string with a single distinct letter. The lexicographically smallest of them is "aaaa".
```

Example 3:

```
Input: lcp = [[4,3,2,1],[3,3,2,1],[2,2,2,1],[1,1,1,3]]
Output: ""
Explanation: lcp[3][3] cannot be equal to 3 since word[3,...,3] consists of only a single letter; Thus, no answer exists.
```

**Constraints:**

- ` 1 <= n == ``````lcp.length == ``````lcp[i].length ` `<= 1000`
- `0 <= lcp[i][j] <= n`

## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public String findTheString(int[][] lcp) {
        int n = lcp.length;

        // potential answer
        char [] arr = new char [n];
        arr[0] = 'a';

        char test;
        boolean found;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            test = 'a';
            found = false;

            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j){
                test = (char)Math.max(test, arr[j]);

                if (lcp[i][j] != 0){
                    found = true;
                    arr[i] = arr[j];
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (found)
                continue;

            ++test;
            arr[i] = test;


            // More than 26 characters needed.
            if (test > 'z')
                return "";
        }

        // lcp from potential string
        int [][] dp = new int [n + 1][n + 1];

        int val;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i){
            for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                if (arr[i] != arr[j])
                    val = 0;
                else
                    val = 1 + dp[i + 1][j + 1];

                dp[i][j] = val;
            }
        }

        // compare dp and lcp as both should be same
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i){
            for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                if (dp[i][j] != lcp[i][j])
                    return "";
            }
        }

        return String.valueOf(arr);
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

- Time complexity : O(n).
- Space complexity : O(n).
