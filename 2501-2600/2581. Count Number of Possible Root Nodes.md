## Problem

Alice has an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented as a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several **guesses** about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:

- Chooses two **distinct** integers `u` and `v` such that there exists an edge `[u, v]` in the tree.
- He tells Alice that `u` is the **parent** of `v` in the tree.

Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array `guesses` where `guesses[j] = [uj, vj]` indicates Bob guessed `uj` to be the parent of `vj`.

Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that **at least** `k` of his guesses are `true`.

Given the 2D integer arrays `edges`, `guesses` and the integer `k`, return **the **number of possible nodes** that can be the root of Alice's tree**. If there is no such tree, return `0`.

Example 1:

```
Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[4,2]], guesses = [[1,3],[0,1],[1,0],[2,4]], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation:
Root = 0, correct guesses = [1,3], [0,1], [2,4]
Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,4]
Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,3], [1,0]
Considering 0, 1, or 2 as root node leads to 3 correct guesses.

```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/12/19/ex-2.png)

```
Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], guesses = [[1,0],[3,4],[2,1],[3,2]], k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation:
Root = 0, correct guesses = [3,4]
Root = 1, correct guesses = [1,0], [3,4]
Root = 2, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,4]
Root = 3, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2], [3,4]
Root = 4, correct guesses = [1,0], [2,1], [3,2]
Considering any node as root will give at least 1 correct guess.

```

**Constraints:**

- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= guesses.length <= 105`
- `0 <= ai, bi, uj, vj <= n - 1`
- `ai != bi`
- `uj != vj`
- `edges` represents a valid tree.
- `guesses[j]` is an edge of the tree.
- `guesses` is unique.
- `0 <= k <= guesses.length`

## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {

    public int rootCount(int[][] edges, int[][] guesses, int k) {
        int n = edges.length + 1;

        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        Set<Integer>[] guessesGraph = new HashSet[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
            guessesGraph[i] = new HashSet<>();
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
        for (int[] guess : guesses) {
            guessesGraph[guess[0]].add(guess[1]);
        }

        int res = 0;
        Map<Long, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            if (dfs(graph, guessesGraph, memo, i, -1) >= k) {
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }


    int dfs(List<Integer>[] graph, Set<Integer>[] guessesGraph, Map<Long, Integer> memo, int current, int prev) {
        long key = (long)current * 1000000 + prev;
        if (memo.containsKey(key)) return memo.get(key);
        int count = prev != -1 && guessesGraph[prev].contains(current) ? 1 : 0;
        for (int next : graph[current]) {
            if (next != prev) {
                count += dfs(graph, guessesGraph, memo, next, current);
            }
        }
        memo.put(key, count);
        return count;
    }

}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

- Time complexity : O(n).
- Space complexity : O(n).
