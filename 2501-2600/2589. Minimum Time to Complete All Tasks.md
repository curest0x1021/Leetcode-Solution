## Problem

There is a computer that can run an unlimited number of tasks **at the same time**. You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [starti, endi, durationi]` indicates that the `ith` task should run for a total of `durationi` seconds (not necessarily continuous) within the **inclusive** time range `[starti, endi]`.

You may turn on the computer only when it needs to run a task. You can also turn it off if it is idle.

Return **the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks**.

Example 1:

```
Input: tasks = [[2,3,1],[4,5,1],[1,5,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- The first task can be run in the inclusive time range [2, 2].
- The second task can be run in the inclusive time range [5, 5].
- The third task can be run in the two inclusive time ranges [2, 2] and [5, 5].
The computer will be on for a total of 2 seconds.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: tasks = [[1,3,2],[2,5,3],[5,6,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
- The first task can be run in the inclusive time range [2, 3].
- The second task can be run in the inclusive time ranges [2, 3] and [5, 5].
- The third task can be run in the two inclusive time range [5, 6].
The computer will be on for a total of 4 seconds.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tasks.length <= 2000`
- `tasks[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= starti, endi <= 2000`
- `1 <= durationi <= endi - starti + 1 `

## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinimumTime(int[][] tasks) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks, (t1, t2) -> (t1[1] - t2[1]));

        boolean[] visited = new boolean[2010];
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
			int nums = 0;
            // check how many we already completed
			for (int j = tasks[i][0]; j <= tasks[i][1]; j++) {
				if (visited[j]) {
					nums++;
				}
			}
			int j = tasks[i][1];
            // complete remainings.
			while (nums < tasks[i][2]) {
				if (!visited[j]) {
					count++;
					nums++;
					visited[j] = true;
				}
				j--;
			}
		}
		return count;

    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

- Time complexity : O(n).
- Space complexity : O(n).
