## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array ```forts``` of length ```n``` representing the positions of several forts. ```forts[i]``` can be ```-1```, ```0```, or ```1``` where:


	
- ```-1``` represents there is **no fort** at the ```ith``` position.
	
- ```0``` indicates there is an **enemy** fort at the ```ith``` position.
	
- ```1``` indicates the fort at the ```ith``` the position is under your command.


Now you have decided to move your army from one of your forts at position ```i``` to an empty position ```j``` such that:


	
- ```0 <= i, j <= n - 1```
	
- The army travels over enemy forts **only**. Formally, for all ```k``` where ```min(i,j) < k < max(i,j)```, ```forts[k] == 0.```


While moving the army, all the enemy forts that come in the way are **captured**.

Return** the **maximum** number of enemy forts that can be captured**. In case it is **impossible** to move your army, or you do not have any fort under your command, return ```0```**.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: forts = [1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1]
Output: 4
Explanation:
- Moving the army from position 0 to position 3 captures 2 enemy forts, at 1 and 2.
- Moving the army from position 8 to position 3 captures 4 enemy forts.
Since 4 is the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured, we return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: forts = [0,0,1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since no enemy fort can be captured, 0 is returned.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= forts.length <= 1000```
	
- ```-1 <= forts[i] <= 1```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int captureForts(int[] a) {
        int n = a.length;
    
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i=0; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] != 0)
                list.add(i);   
        }
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (a[list.get(i)] == -1 * a[list.get(i + 1)])
                max = Math.max(max,list.get(i + 1) - list.get(i) - 1);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
