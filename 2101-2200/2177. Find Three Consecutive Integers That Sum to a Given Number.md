## Problem

Given an integer ```num```, return **three consecutive integers (as a sorted array)**** that **sum** to **```num```. If ```num``` cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return** an **empty** array.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 33
Output: [10,11,12]
Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 4
Output: []
Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```0 <= num <= 1015```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public long[] sumOfThree(long num) {
        if (num % 3 == 0) {
            return new long[] {num / 3 - 1, num / 3, num / 3 + 1};
        }
        return new long[0];
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
