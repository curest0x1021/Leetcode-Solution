## Problem

In a linked list of size ```n```, where ```n``` is **even**, the ```ith``` node (**0-indexed**) of the linked list is known as the **twin** of the ```(n-1-i)th``` node, if ```0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1```.


	
- For example, if ```n = 4```, then node ```0``` is the twin of node ```3```, and node ```1``` is the twin of node ```2```. These are the only nodes with twins for ```n = 4```.


The **twin sum **is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the ```head``` of a linked list with even length, return **the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list**.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg1drawio.png)

```
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg2drawio.png)

```
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/03/eg3drawio.png)

```
Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the list is an **even** integer in the range ```[2, 105]```.
	
- ```1 <= Node.val <= 105```



## Solution (Java)

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int pairSum(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        if (slow.next == null) {
            return head.val + slow.val;
        }
        ListNode tail = head;
        ListNode pivot = reverse(slow);
        while (pivot != null) {
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, (tail.val + pivot.val));
            tail = tail.next;
            pivot = pivot.next;
        }
        return maxSum;
    }

    private ListNode reverse(ListNode head) {
        ListNode tail = head;
        ListNode prev = null;
        while (tail != null) {
            ListNode temp = tail.next;
            tail.next = prev;
            prev = tail;
            tail = temp;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```
