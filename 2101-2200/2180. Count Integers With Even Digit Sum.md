## Problem

Given a positive integer ```num```, return **the number of positive integers **less than or equal to**** ```num``` **whose digit sums are **even****.

The **digit sum** of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.    
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 30
Output: 14
Explanation:
The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are
2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= num <= 1000```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int countEven(int n) {
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            return n / 2;
        } else {
            int ans = 0;
            int num = n;
            while (num != 0) {
                ans += num % 10;
                num /= 10;
            }
            if (ans % 2 == 0) {
                return n / 2;
            } else {
                return n / 2 - 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
