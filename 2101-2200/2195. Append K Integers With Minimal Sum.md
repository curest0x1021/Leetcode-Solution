## Problem

You are given an integer array ```nums``` and an integer ```k```. Append ```k``` **unique positive** integers that do **not** appear in ```nums``` to ```nums``` such that the resulting total sum is **minimum**.

Return** the sum of the** ```k``` **integers appended to** ```nums```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,4,25,10,25], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The two unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 2 and 3.
The resulting sum of nums is 1 + 4 + 25 + 10 + 25 + 2 + 3 = 70, which is the minimum.
The sum of the two integers appended is 2 + 3 = 5, so we return 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,6], k = 6
Output: 25
Explanation: The six unique positive integers that do not appear in nums which we append are 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
The resulting sum of nums is 5 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 36, which is the minimum. 
The sum of the six integers appended is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 25, so we return 25.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9```
	
- ```1 <= k <= 10^8```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public long minimalKSum(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        long sum = 0;
        int n = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i == 0 || nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                if (nums[i] - n > k) {
                    break;
                }
                sum += nums[i];
                n++;
            }
        }
        long t = n + (long) k;
        return (1 + t) * t / 2 - sum;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
