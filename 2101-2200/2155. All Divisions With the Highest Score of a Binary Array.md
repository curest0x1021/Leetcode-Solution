## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** binary array ```nums``` of length ```n```. ```nums``` can be divided at index ```i``` (where ```0 <= i <= n)``` into two arrays (possibly empty) ```numsleft``` and ```numsright```:


	
- ```numsleft``` has all the elements of ```nums``` between index ```0``` and ```i - 1``` **(inclusive)**, while ```numsright``` has all the elements of nums between index ```i``` and ```n - 1``` **(inclusive)**.
	
- If ```i == 0```, ```numsleft``` is **empty**, while ```numsright``` has all the elements of ```nums```.
	
- If ```i == n```, ```numsleft``` has all the elements of nums, while ```numsright``` is **empty**.


The **division score** of an index ```i``` is the **sum** of the number of ```0```'s in ```numsleft``` and the number of ```1```'s in ```numsright```.

Return ****all distinct indices** that have the **highest** possible **division score****. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,0]
Output: [2,4]
Explanation: Division at index
- 0: numsleft is []. numsright is [0,0,1,0]. The score is 0 + 1 = 1.
- 1: numsleft is [0]. numsright is [0,1,0]. The score is 1 + 1 = 2.
- 2: numsleft is [0,0]. numsright is [1,0]. The score is 2 + 1 = 3.
- 3: numsleft is [0,0,1]. numsright is [0]. The score is 2 + 0 = 2.
- 4: numsleft is [0,0,1,0]. numsright is []. The score is 3 + 0 = 3.
Indices 2 and 4 both have the highest possible division score 3.
Note the answer [4,2] would also be accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Division at index
- 0: numsleft is []. numsright is [0,0,0]. The score is 0 + 0 = 0.
- 1: numsleft is [0]. numsright is [0,0]. The score is 1 + 0 = 1.
- 2: numsleft is [0,0]. numsright is [0]. The score is 2 + 0 = 2.
- 3: numsleft is [0,0,0]. numsright is []. The score is 3 + 0 = 3.
Only index 3 has the highest possible division score 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [0]
Explanation: Division at index
- 0: numsleft is []. numsright is [1,1]. The score is 0 + 2 = 2.
- 1: numsleft is [1]. numsright is [1]. The score is 0 + 1 = 1.
- 2: numsleft is [1,1]. numsright is []. The score is 0 + 0 = 0.
Only index 0 has the highest possible division score 2.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == nums.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 10^5```
	
- ```nums[i]``` is either ```0``` or ```1```.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> maxScoreIndices(int[] nums) {
        int curone = 0;
        int curzero = 0;
        int max = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            curone += i;
        }
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (curzero + curone > max) {
                list.clear();
                list.add(i);
                max = curzero + curone;
            } else if (curzero + curone == max) {
                list.add(i);
            }
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                curone--;
            } else {
                curzero++;
            }
        }
        if (curzero > max) {
            list.clear();
            list.add(nums.length);
        } else if (curzero == max) {
            list.add(nums.length);
        }
        return list;
    }
}
```
