## Problem

You are given an array ```time``` where ```time[i]``` denotes the time taken by the ```ith``` bus to complete **one trip**.

Each bus can make multiple trips **successively**; that is, the next trip can start **immediately after** completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates **independently**; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.

You are also given an integer ```totalTrips```, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make **in total**. Return **the **minimum time** required for all buses to complete **at least** **```totalTrips```** trips**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
So the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: time = [2], totalTrips = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is only one bus, and it will complete its first trip at t = 2.
So the minimum time needed to complete 1 trip is 2.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= time.length <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= time[i], totalTrips <= 107```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public long minimumTime(int[] time, int totalTrips) {
        return bs(0, Long.MAX_VALUE, time, totalTrips);
    }

    private long bs(long left, long right, int[] time, long totalTrips) {
        if (left > right) {
            return Long.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        long mid = (left + right) >> 1;
        return isPossible(time, mid, totalTrips)
                ? Math.min(mid, bs(left, mid - 1, time, totalTrips))
                : bs(mid + 1, right, time, totalTrips);
    }

    private boolean isPossible(int[] time, long mid, long totalTrips) {
        long count = 0;
        for (int i : time) {
            count += mid / i;
            if (count >= totalTrips) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
