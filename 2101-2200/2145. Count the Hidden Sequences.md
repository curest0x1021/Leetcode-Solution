## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** array of ```n``` integers ```differences```, which describes the **differences **between each pair of **consecutive **integers of a **hidden** sequence of length ```(n + 1)```. More formally, call the hidden sequence ```hidden```, then we have that ```differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i]```.

You are further given two integers ```lower``` and ```upper``` that describe the **inclusive** range of values ```[lower, upper]``` that the hidden sequence can contain.


	For example, given ```differences = [1, -3, 4]```, ```lower = 1```, ```upper = 6```, the hidden sequence is a sequence of length ```4``` whose elements are in between ```1``` and ```6``` (**inclusive**).

	
		
- ```[3, 4, 1, 5]``` and ```[4, 5, 2, 6]``` are possible hidden sequences.
		
- ```[5, 6, 3, 7]``` is not possible since it contains an element greater than ```6```.
		
- ```[1, 2, 3, 4]``` is not possible since the differences are not correct.
	
	


Return **the number of **possible** hidden sequences there are.** If there are no possible sequences, return ```0```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: differences = [1,-3,4], lower = 1, upper = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The possible hidden sequences are:
- [3, 4, 1, 5]
- [4, 5, 2, 6]
Thus, we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: differences = [3,-4,5,1,-2], lower = -4, upper = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The possible hidden sequences are:
- [-3, 0, -4, 1, 2, 0]
- [-2, 1, -3, 2, 3, 1]
- [-1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 2]
- [0, 3, -1, 4, 5, 3]
Thus, we return 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: differences = [4,-7,2], lower = 3, upper = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no possible hidden sequences. Thus, we return 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == differences.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 10^5```
	
- ```-10^5 <= differences[i] <= 10^5```
	
- ```-10^5 <= lower <= upper <= 10^5```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfArrays(int[] diff, int lower, int upper) {
        int n = diff.length;
        if (lower == upper) {
            for (int j : diff) {
                if (j != 0) {
                    return 0;
                }
            }
        }
        int max = -(int) 1e9;
        int min = (int) 1e9;
        int[] hidden = new int[n + 1];
        hidden[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            hidden[i] = hidden[i - 1] + diff[i - 1];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            if (hidden[i] > max) {
                max = hidden[i];
            }
            if (hidden[i] < min) {
                min = hidden[i];
            }
        }
        int low = lower - min;
        int high = upper - max;
        if (low > high) {
            return 0;
        }
        return (high - low) + 1;
    }
}
```
