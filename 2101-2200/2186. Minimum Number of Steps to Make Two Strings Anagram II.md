## Problem

You are given two strings ```s``` and ```t```. In one step, you can append **any character** to either ```s``` or ```t```.

Return **the minimum number of steps to make **```s```** and **```t```** **anagrams** of each other.**

An **anagram** of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode", t = "coats"
Output: 7
Explanation: 
- In 2 steps, we can append the letters in "as" onto s = "leetcode", forming s = "leetcodeas".
- In 5 steps, we can append the letters in "leede" onto t = "coats", forming t = "coatsleede".
"leetcodeas" and "coatsleede" are now anagrams of each other.
We used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.
It can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "night", t = "thing"
Output: 0
Explanation: The given strings are already anagrams of each other. Thus, we do not need any further steps.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length, t.length <= 2 * 10^5```
	
- ```s``` and ```t``` consist of lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        int[] a = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            a[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            a[t.charAt(i) - 'a']--;
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (int j : a) {
            sum += Math.abs(j);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
