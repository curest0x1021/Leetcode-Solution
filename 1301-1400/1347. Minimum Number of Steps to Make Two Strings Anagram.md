## Problem

You are given two strings of the same length ```s``` and ```t```. In one step you can choose **any character** of ```t``` and replace it with **another character**.

Return **the minimum number of steps** to make ```t``` an anagram of ```s```.

An **Anagram** of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
Output: 5
Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
Output: 0
Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams. 
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104```
	
- ```s.length == t.length```
	
- ```s``` and ```t``` consist of lowercase English letters only.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        int[] counts = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            counts[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            if (counts[c - 'a'] > 0) {
                counts[c - 'a']--;
            }
        }
        return Arrays.stream(counts).sum();
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
