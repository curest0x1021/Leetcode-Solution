## Problem

There are ```n``` computers numbered from ```0``` to ```n - 1``` connected by ethernet cables ```connections``` forming a network where ```connections[i] = [ai, bi]``` represents a connection between computers ```ai``` and ```bi```. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

You are given an initial computer network ```connections```. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.

Return **the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected**. If it is not possible, return ```-1```.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample_1_1677.png)

```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample_2_1677.png)

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are not enough cables.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 10^5```
	
- ```1 <= connections.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 10^5)```
	
- ```connections[i].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= ai, bi < n```
	
- ```ai != bi```
	
- There are no repeated connections.
	
- No two computers are connected by more than one cable.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    private static final int IMPOSSIBLE_TO_CONNECT = -1;
    private int disconnectedComputers;
    private int[] parent;
    private int[] rank;

    public int makeConnected(int totalNumberOfComputers, int[][] connections) {
        if (connections.length < totalNumberOfComputers - 1) {
            return IMPOSSIBLE_TO_CONNECT;
        }

        disconnectedComputers = totalNumberOfComputers;
        rank = new int[totalNumberOfComputers];
        parent = new int[totalNumberOfComputers];
        Arrays.setAll(parent, intFromZero -> intFromZero++);

        for (final int[] connection : connections) {
            unionFind(connection[0], connection[1]);
        }

        return disconnectedComputers - 1;
    }

    private void unionFind(int first, int second) {
        int parentFirst = findParent(first);
        int parentSecond = findParent(second);

        if (parentFirst != parentSecond) {
            joinByRank(parentFirst, parentSecond);
            disconnectedComputers--;
        }
    }

    private int findParent(int index) {
        if (parent[index] != index) {
            parent[index] = findParent(parent[index]);
        }
        return parent[index];
    }

    private void joinByRank(int first, int second) {
        if (rank[first] < rank[second]) {
            parent[first] = second;
        } else if (rank[second] < rank[first]) {
            parent[second] = first;
        } else {
            parent[first] = second;
            rank[second]++;
        }
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
