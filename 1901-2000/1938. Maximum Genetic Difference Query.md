## Problem

There is a rooted tree consisting of ```n``` nodes numbered ```0``` to ```n - 1```. Each node's number denotes its **unique genetic value** (i.e. the genetic value of node ```x``` is ```x```). The **genetic difference** between two genetic values is defined as the **bitwise-****XOR** of their values. You are given the integer array ```parents```, where ```parents[i]``` is the parent for node ```i```. If node ```x``` is the **root** of the tree, then ```parents[x] == -1```.

You are also given the array ```queries``` where ```queries[i] = [nodei, vali]```. For each query ```i```, find the **maximum genetic difference** between ```vali``` and ```pi```, where ```pi``` is the genetic value of any node that is on the path between ```nodei``` and the root (including ```nodei``` and the root). More formally, you want to maximize ```vali XOR pi```.

Return **an array **```ans```** where **```ans[i]```** is the answer to the **```ith```** query**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: parents = [-1,0,1,1], queries = [[0,2],[3,2],[2,5]]
Output: [2,3,7]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- [0,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 2 XOR 0 = 2.
- [3,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 2 XOR 1 = 3.
- [2,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/c2.png)

```
Input: parents = [3,7,-1,2,0,7,0,2], queries = [[4,6],[1,15],[0,5]]
Output: [6,14,7]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- [4,6]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 6 XOR 0 = 6.
- [1,15]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 15 XOR 1 = 14.
- [0,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= parents.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```0 <= parents[i] <= parents.length - 1``` for every node ```i``` that is **not** the root.
	
- ```parents[root] == -1```
	
- ```1 <= queries.length <= 3 * 10^4```
	
- ```0 <= nodei <= parents.length - 1```
	
- ```0 <= vali <= 2 * 10^5```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxGeneticDifference(int[] parents, int[][] queries) {
        int n = parents.length;
        int[][] fd = new int[n][];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            fill(parents, n, fd, i);
        }
        int[] ret = new int[queries.length];
        for (int q = 0; q < queries.length; q++) {
            int cur = queries[q][0];
            int value = queries[q][1];
            for (int p = 30; p >= 0; p--) {
                int msk = 1 << p;
                if ((value & msk) != (cur & msk)) {
                    ret[q] |= msk;
                } else if (fd[cur][p] >= 0) {
                    ret[q] |= msk;
                    cur = fd[cur][p];
                }
            }
        }
        return ret;
    }

    private void fill(int[] parents, int n, int[][] fd, int i) {
        if (fd[i] == null) {
            fd[i] = new int[31];
            int a = parents[i];
            if (a >= 0) {
                fill(parents, n, fd, a);
            }
            for (int p = 30; p >= 0; p--) {
                if (a == -1) {
                    fd[i][p] = -1;
                } else {
                    if ((i & (1 << p)) == (a & (1 << p))) {
                        fd[i][p] = fd[a][p];
                    } else {
                        fd[i][p] = a;
                        a = fd[a][p];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
