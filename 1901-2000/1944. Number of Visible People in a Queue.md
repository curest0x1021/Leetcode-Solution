## Problem

There are ```n``` people standing in a queue, and they numbered from ```0``` to ```n - 1``` in **left to right** order. You are given an array ```heights``` of **distinct** integers where ```heights[i]``` represents the height of the ```ith``` person.

A person can **see** another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is **shorter** than both of them. More formally, the ```ith``` person can see the ```jth``` person if ```i < j``` and ```min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])```.

Return **an array **```answer```** of length **```n```** where **```answer[i]```** is the **number of people** the **```ith```** person can **see** to their right in the queue**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [10,6,8,5,11,9]
Output: [3,1,2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
Person 0 can see person 1, 2, and 4.
Person 1 can see person 2.
Person 2 can see person 3 and 4.
Person 3 can see person 4.
Person 4 can see person 5.
Person 5 can see no one since nobody is to the right of them.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,10]
Output: [4,1,1,1,0]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == heights.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 10^5```
	
- ```1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5```
	
- All the values of ```heights``` are **unique**.



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] canSeePersonsCount(int[] heights) {
        int size = heights.length;
        int[] stack = new int[size];
        int idx = 0;
        stack[0] = heights[size - 1];
        int[] visible = new int[size];
        for (int i = size - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            int count = 0;
            while (idx >= 0 && heights[i] >= stack[idx]) {
                count++;
                idx--;
            }
            if (idx >= 0) {
                count++;
            }
            stack[++idx] = heights[i];
            visible[i] = count;
        }
        return visible;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
