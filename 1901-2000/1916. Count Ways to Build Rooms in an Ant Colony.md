## Problem

You are an ant tasked with adding ```n``` new rooms numbered ```0``` to ```n-1``` to your colony. You are given the expansion plan as a **0-indexed** integer array of length ```n```, ```prevRoom```, where ```prevRoom[i]``` indicates that you must build room ```prevRoom[i]``` before building room ```i```, and these two rooms must be connected **directly**. Room ```0``` is already built, so ```prevRoom[0] = -1```. The expansion plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be reachable from room ```0```.

You can only build **one room** at a time, and you can travel freely between rooms you have **already built** only if they are **connected**. You can choose to build **any room** as long as its **previous room** is already built.

Return **the **number of different orders** you can build all the rooms in**. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** ```109 + 7```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: prevRoom = [-1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one way to build the additional rooms: 0 → 1 → 2
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/19/d2.JPG)


```
Input: prevRoom = [-1,0,0,1,2]
Output: 6
Explanation:
The 6 ways are:
0 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 4
0 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 3
0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 3
0 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 4
0 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 3
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == prevRoom.length```
	
- ```2 <= n <= 105```
	
- ```prevRoom[0] == -1```
	
- ```0 <= prevRoom[i] < n``` for all ```1 <= i < n```
	
- Every room is reachable from room ```0``` once all the rooms are built.


## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    int mod = (int)1e9 + 7;
    Map<Integer, List<Integer>> edges = new HashMap<>();
    int[] fac, inv;
    
    public int waysToBuildRooms(int[] prevRoom) {
        int n = prevRoom.length;

        this.fac = new int[n];//fac[i]=i!
        this.inv = new int[n];//inv[i]=i!^(-1)
        fac[0] = inv[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            fac[i] = (int)((long)fac[i - 1] * i % mod);
            inv[i] = quickmul(fac[i], mod - 2);// (fac[i]^(-1))%mod = (fac[i]^(mod-2))%mod
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (edges.containsKey(prevRoom[i]) == false)
                edges.put(prevRoom[i], new ArrayList<Integer>());
            edges.get(prevRoom[i]).add(i);
        }

        return dfs(0)[1];      
    }

    public int[] dfs(int node) {
        if (edges.containsKey(node) == false)
            return new int[]{1, 1};
        int count = 1, arr = 1;
        for (int v : edges.get(node)) {
            int[] ret = dfs(v);
            count += ret[0];
            arr = (int)((long)arr * ret[1] % mod * inv[ret[0]] % mod);
        }
        arr = (int)((long)arr * fac[count - 1] % mod);
        return new int[]{count, arr};
    }

    public int quickmul(int x, int y) {
        long ret = 1, cur = x;
        while (y > 0) {
            if ((y & 1) == 1)
                ret = ret * cur % mod;
            cur = cur * cur % mod;
            y >>= 1;
        }
        return (int)ret;
    }
}

```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
