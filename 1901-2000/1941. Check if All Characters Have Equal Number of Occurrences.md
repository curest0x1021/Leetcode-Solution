## Problem

Given a string ```s```, return ```true```** if **```s```** is a **good** string, or **```false```** otherwise**.

A string ```s``` is **good** if **all** the characters that appear in ```s``` have the **same** number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abacbc"
Output: true
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaabb"
Output: false
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 1000```
	
- ```s``` consists of lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean areOccurrencesEqual(String s) {
        int[] counter = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            counter[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        int bench = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (bench == 0) {
                if (counter[i] != 0) {
                    bench = counter[i];
                }
            } else {
                if (counter[i] != 0 && counter[i] != bench) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
