## Problem

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string ```text``` of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string ```brokenLetters``` of all **distinct** letter keys that are broken, return **the **number of words** in** ```text``` **you can fully type using this keyboard**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= text.length <= 10^4```
	
- ```0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26```
	
- ```text``` consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
	
- Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
	
- ```brokenLetters``` consists of **distinct** lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int canBeTypedWords(String text, String brokenLetters) {
        String[] words = text.split(" ");
        int count = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            boolean broken = false;
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                if (brokenLetters.indexOf(c) != -1) {
                    broken = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!broken) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
