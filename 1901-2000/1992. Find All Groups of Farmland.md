## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** ```m x n``` binary matrix ```land``` where a ```0``` represents a hectare of forested land and a ```1``` represents a hectare of farmland.

To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist **entirely** of farmland. These rectangular areas are called **groups**. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is **not** four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.

```land``` can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of ```land``` is ```(0, 0)``` and the bottom right corner of ```land``` is ```(m-1, n-1)```. Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each **group** of farmland. A **group** of farmland with a top left corner at ```(r1, c1)``` and a bottom right corner at ```(r2, c2)``` is represented by the 4-length array ```[r1, c1, r2, c2].```

Return **a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each **group** of farmland in **```land```**. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in **any order****.

```
Input: land = [[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]
Explanation:
The first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[0][0].
The second group has a top left corner at land[1][1] and a bottom right corner at land[2][2].
```

```
Input: land = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,1,1]]
Explanation:
The first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[1][1].
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/27/screenshot-2021-07-27-at-12-32-24-copy-of-diagram-drawio-diagrams-net.png)

```
Input: land = [[0]]
Output: []
Explanation:
There are no groups of farmland.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```m == land.length```
	
- ```n == land[i].length```
	
- ```1 <= m, n <= 300```
	
- ```land``` consists of only ```0```'s and ```1```'s.
	
- Groups of farmland are **rectangular** in shape.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    private final List<int[]> res = new ArrayList<>();

    public int[][] findFarmland(int[][] land) {
        if (land == null || land.length == 0) {
            return new int[][] {};
        }
        int m = land.length;
        int n = land[0].length;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (land[i][j] == 1) {
                    int[] dirs = new int[4];
                    dirs[0] = i;
                    dirs[1] = j;
                    dirs[2] = i;
                    dirs[3] = j;
                    dfs(land, i, j, dirs);
                    res.add(dirs);
                }
            }
        }
        return res.toArray(new int[0][]);
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] land, int i, int j, int[] dirs) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= land.length || j < 0 || j >= land[0].length || land[i][j] != 1) {
            return;
        }
        land[i][j] = -1;
        dfs(land, i + 1, j, dirs);
        dfs(land, i, j + 1, dirs);
        dirs[0] = Math.min(dirs[0], i);
        dirs[1] = Math.min(dirs[1], j);
        dirs[2] = Math.max(dirs[2], i);
        dirs[3] = Math.max(dirs[3], j);
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
