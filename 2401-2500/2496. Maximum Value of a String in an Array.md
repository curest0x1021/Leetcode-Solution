## Problem

The **value** of an alphanumeric string can be defined as:


	
- The **numeric** representation of the string in base ```10```, if it comprises of digits **only**.
	
- The **length** of the string, otherwise.


Given an array ```strs``` of alphanumeric strings, return **the **maximum value** of any string in **```strs```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: strs = ["alic3","bob","3","4","00000"]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
- "alic3" consists of both letters and digits, so its value is its length, i.e. 5.
- "bob" consists only of letters, so its value is also its length, i.e. 3.
- "3" consists only of digits, so its value is its numeric equivalent, i.e. 3.
- "4" also consists only of digits, so its value is 4.
- "00000" consists only of digits, so its value is 0.
Hence, the maximum value is 5, of "alic3".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: strs = ["1","01","001","0001"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Each string in the array has value 1. Hence, we return 1.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= strs.length <= 100```
	
- ```1 <= strs[i].length <= 9```
	
- ```strs[i]``` consists of only lowercase English letters and digits.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumValue(String[] s) {
        int p=0;
        for(String k:s)
        {
            int m=0,d=0,f=0;
            for(char c:k.toCharArray())
            {
                if(c>='a' && c<='z')
                {
                    m++;
                }
                else if(c>='0' && c<='9')
                {
                    d++;
                    f=f*10+(c-'0');
                }
            }
            if(m>0 && d>0)
            {
                p=Math.max(p,k.length());
            }
            else if(m==0)
            {
                p=Math.max(p,f);
            }
            else if(d==0)
            {
                p=Math.max(p,k.length());
            }
        }
        return p;
    }
}
```
