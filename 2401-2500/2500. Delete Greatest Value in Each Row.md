# 2500. Delete Greatest Value in Each Row

- Difficulty: Easy.
- Related Topics: Array, Sorting, Matrix.
- Similar Questions: Equal Row and Column Pairs.

## Problem

You are given an ```m x n``` matrix ```grid``` consisting of positive integers.

Perform the following operation until ```grid``` becomes empty:


	
- Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.
	
- Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.


**Note** that the number of columns decreases by one after each operation.

Return **the answer after performing the operations described above**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,4],[3,3,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.
- In the first operation, we remove 4 from the first row and 3 from the second row (notice that, there are two cells with value 3 and we can remove any of them). We add 4 to the answer.
- In the second operation, we remove 2 from the first row and 3 from the second row. We add 3 to the answer.
- In the third operation, we remove 1 from the first row and 1 from the second row. We add 1 to the answer.
The final answer = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/19/q1ex2.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[10]]
Output: 10
Explanation: The diagram above shows the removed values in each step.
- In the first operation, we remove 10 from the first row. We add 10 to the answer.
The final answer = 10.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```m == grid.length```
	
- ```n == grid[i].length```
	
- ```1 <= m, n <= 50```
	
- ```1 <= grid[i][j] <= 100```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int deleteGreatestValue(int[][] grid) {
        boolean[][] picked = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        int result = 0;
        while(!check(picked)) {
            int maxValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
                int maxValueForRow = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                int maxColIndexForRow = 0; 
                for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++) {
                    if (picked[row][col]) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    if (grid[row][col] >= maxValueForRow) {
                        maxValueForRow = grid[row][col];
                        maxColIndexForRow = col;
                    }
                }
                picked[row][maxColIndexForRow] = true; 
                maxValue = Math.max(maxValue, maxValueForRow);
            }
            result = result + maxValue;
        }
        return result;
    }    
    public boolean check(boolean[][] picked) {
        for (int i = 0; i < picked.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < picked[0].length; j++) {
                if (!picked[i][j]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
