## Problem

You are given a 2D integer array ```intervals``` where ```intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]``` represents the **inclusive** interval ```[lefti, righti]```.

You have to divide the intervals into one or more **groups** such that each interval is in **exactly** one group, and no two intervals that are in the same group **intersect** each other.

Return **the **minimum** number of groups you need to make**.

Two intervals **intersect** if there is at least one common number between them. For example, the intervals ```[1, 5]``` and ```[5, 8]``` intersect.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[5,10],[6,8],[1,5],[2,3],[1,10]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can divide the intervals into the following groups:
- Group 1: [1, 5], [6, 8].
- Group 2: [2, 3], [5, 10].
- Group 3: [1, 10].
It can be proven that it is not possible to divide the intervals into fewer than 3 groups.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[5,6],[8,10],[11,13]]
Output: 1
Explanation: None of the intervals overlap, so we can put all of them in one group.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```intervals[i].length == 2```
	
- ```1 <= lefti <= righti <= 10^6```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minGroups(int[][] intervals) {
        int m = 0; 
        for(int i[] : intervals){
            m = Math.max(m,i[0]);
            m = Math.max(m,i[1]);
        }
        long arr[] = new long[m+2];
        for(int a[] : intervals){
            arr[a[0]] += 1;
            arr[a[1]+1] -= 1;
        }
        long max = 0l;
        for(int i = 1; i <= m +1; i++){
            arr[i] += arr[i-1];
            max = Math.max(max,arr[i]);
            
        }
        return (int)max;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
