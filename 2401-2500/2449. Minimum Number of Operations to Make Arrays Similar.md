# 2449. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Arrays Similar

- Difficulty: Hard.
- Related Topics: Array, Greedy, Sorting.
- Similar Questions: Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal.

## Problem

You are given two positive integer arrays ```nums``` and ```target```, of the same length.

In one operation, you can choose any two **distinct** indices ```i``` and ```j``` where ```0 <= i, j < nums.length``` and:


	
- set ```nums[i] = nums[i] + 2``` and
	
- set ```nums[j] = nums[j] - 2```.


Two arrays are considered to be **similar** if the frequency of each element is the same.

Return **the minimum number of operations required to make **```nums```** similar to **```target```. The test cases are generated such that ```nums``` can always be similar to ```target```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [8,12,6], target = [2,14,10]
Output: 2
Explanation: It is possible to make nums similar to target in two operations:
- Choose i = 0 and j = 2, nums = [10,12,4].
- Choose i = 1 and j = 2, nums = [10,14,2].
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations needed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5], target = [4,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can make nums similar to target in one operation:
- Choose i = 1 and j = 2, nums = [1,4,3].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array nums is already similiar to target.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == nums.length == target.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i], target[i] <= 106```
	
- It is possible to make ```nums``` similar to ```target```.
