## Problem

There is an undirected tree with ```n``` nodes labeled from ```0``` to ```n - 1```, rooted at node ```0```. You are given a 2D integer array ```edges``` of length ```n - 1``` where ```edges[i] = [ai, bi]``` indicates that there is an edge between nodes ```ai``` and ```bi``` in the tree.

At every node ```i```, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers ```amount```, where ```amount[i]``` represents:


	
- the price needed to open the gate at node ```i```, if ```amount[i]``` is negative, or,
	
- the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node ```i```, otherwise.


The game goes on as follows:


	
- Initially, Alice is at node ```0``` and Bob is at node ```bob```.
	
- At every second, Alice and Bob **each** move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some **leaf node**, while Bob moves towards node ```0```.
	For **every** node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:
	
		
- If the gate is **already open**, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.
		
- If Alice and Bob reach the node **simultaneously**, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is ```c```, then both Alice and Bob pay ```c / 2``` each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is ```c```, both of them receive ```c / 2``` each.
	
	
	
- If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node ```0```, he stops moving. Note that these events are **independent** of each other.


Return** the **maximum** net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node.**

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/29/eg1.png)

```
Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]], bob = 3, amount = [-2,4,2,-4,6]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:
- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.
  Alice's net income is now -2.
- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. 
  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.
  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.
- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.
  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.
- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.
Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.
It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/29/eg2.png)

```
Input: edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350]
Output: -7280
Explanation: 
Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.
Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280. 
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= n <= 105```
	
- ```edges.length == n - 1```
	
- ```edges[i].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= ai, bi < n```
	
- ```ai != bi```
	
- ```edges``` represents a valid tree.
	
- ```1 <= bob < n```
	
- ```amount.length == n```
	
- ```amount[i]``` is an **even** integer in the range ```[-104, 104]```.
