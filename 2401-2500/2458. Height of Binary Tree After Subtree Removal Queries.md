## Problem

You are given the ```root``` of a **binary tree** with ```n``` nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from ```1``` to ```n```. You are also given an array ```queries``` of size ```m```.

You have to perform ```m``` **independent** queries on the tree where in the ```ith``` query you do the following:


	
- **Remove** the subtree rooted at the node with the value ```queries[i]``` from the tree. It is **guaranteed** that ```queries[i]``` will **not** be equal to the value of the root.


Return **an array **```answer```** of size **```m```** where **```answer[i]```** is the height of the tree after performing the **```ith```** query**.

**Note**:


	
- The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its **initial** state after each query.
	
- The height of a tree is the **number of edges in the longest simple path** from the root to some node in the tree.


 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-1.png)

```
Input: root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-2.png)

```
Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
Output: [3,2,3,2]
Explanation: We have the following queries:
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the tree is ```n```.
	
- ```2 <= n <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= Node.val <= n```
	
- All the values in the tree are **unique**.
	
- ```m == queries.length```
	
- ```1 <= m <= min(n, 104)```
	
- ```1 <= queries[i] <= n```
	
- ```queries[i] != root.val```



## Solution (Java)

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
