## Problem

You are given an integer ```n```. There are ```n``` rooms numbered from ```0``` to ```n - 1```.

You are given a 2D integer array ```meetings``` where ```meetings[i] = [starti, endi]``` means that a meeting will be held during the **half-closed** time interval ```[starti, endi)```. All the values of ```starti``` are **unique**.

Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:


	
- Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the **lowest** number.
	
- If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the **same** duration as the original meeting.
	
- When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original **start** time should be given the room.


Return** the **number** of the room that held the most meetings. **If there are multiple rooms, return** the room with the **lowest** number.**

A **half-closed interval** ```[a, b)``` is the interval between ```a``` and ```b``` **including** ```a``` and **not including** ```b```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
- At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
- At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
- At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1. 
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 100```
	
- ```1 <= meetings.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```meetings[i].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^5```
	
- All the values of ```starti``` are **unique**.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
  public int mostBooked(int n, int[][] meetings) {
    int ans[] = new int[n];                                                     //for numbers of usages 
    PriorityQueue<int[]> ends = new PriorityQueue<>
      (n, (int[] o1, int[] o2) -> o2[0]!=o1[0] ? o1[0]-o2[0] : o1[1]-o2[1]);    //end , room   
    TreeSet<Integer> rooms = new TreeSet<>();                                   //for empty rooms
    for(int i = 0; i != n; i++) rooms.add(i);                                   //check all rooms as empty 
    Arrays.sort(meetings, (int[] o1, int[] o2) -> o1[0] - o2[0]);               //sorting for minimal starts
  
    for(int[] m: meetings){
      while(!ends.isEmpty() && ends.peek()[0] <= m[0]) rooms.add(ends.poll()[1]);       //empty all rooms for current time
      
      if(!rooms.isEmpty()){                                          //if we have empty rooms
        int room = rooms.pollFirst();                                //fetch room with minimal number
        ans[room]++;                                                 //check it as used
        ends.add(new int[]{m[1], room});                             //and put it into queue
      }else{                                                     //if we not have any empty room 
        int[] e = ends.poll();                                   //fetch from queue first room that will be empty 
        ans[e[1]]++;                                             //and again use it (check it as used)
        ends.add(new int[]{e[0] + m[1] - m[0], e[1]});           //and reuse it with correct time
      } 
    }
    
    int maxi = 0, id = -1;                          //fetch minimal index from array with numbers of usages
    for(int i = 0; i != n; i++)
      if(ans[i] > maxi) {maxi = ans[i]; id = i;}
    
    return id;
  }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
