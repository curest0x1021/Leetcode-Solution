# 2452. Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary

## Problem

You are given two string arrays, ```queries``` and ```dictionary```. All words in each array comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.

In one **edit** you can take a word from ```queries```, and change any letter in it to any other letter. Find all words from ```queries``` that, after a **maximum** of two edits, equal some word from ```dictionary```.

Return** a list of all words from **```queries```**, ****that match with some word from **```dictionary```** after a maximum of **two edits****. Return the words in the **same order** they appear in ```queries```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: queries = ["word","note","ants","wood"], dictionary = ["wood","joke","moat"]
Output: ["word","note","wood"]
Explanation:
- Changing the 'r' in "word" to 'o' allows it to equal the dictionary word "wood".
- Changing the 'n' to 'j' and the 't' to 'k' in "note" changes it to "joke".
- It would take more than 2 edits for "ants" to equal a dictionary word.
- "wood" can remain unchanged (0 edits) and match the corresponding dictionary word.
Thus, we return ["word","note","wood"].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: queries = ["yes"], dictionary = ["not"]
Output: []
Explanation:
Applying any two edits to "yes" cannot make it equal to "not". Thus, we return an empty array.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= queries.length, dictionary.length <= 100```
	
- ```n == queries[i].length == dictionary[j].length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 100```
	
- All ```queries[i]``` and ```dictionary[j]``` are composed of lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    int hamming(String s1, String s2)
    {
        int h = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); ++i)
            { h += s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i) ? 1 : 0; }
        return h;
    };

    public List<String> twoEditWords(String[] queries, String[] dictionary) 
    {
        ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (String q : queries)
            for (String d : dictionary)
                if (hamming(q,d) <= 2)
                {
                    words.add(q);
                    break;
                }
        
        return words;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
