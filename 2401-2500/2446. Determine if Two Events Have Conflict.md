## Problem

You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that happened **on the same day**, ```event1``` and ```event2```, where:


	
- ```event1 = [startTime1, endTime1]``` and
	
- ```event2 = [startTime2, endTime2]```.


Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of ```HH:MM```.

A **conflict** happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).

Return ```true```** if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return **```false```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: event1 = ["01:15","02:00"], event2 = ["02:00","03:00"]
Output: true
Explanation: The two events intersect at time 2:00.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: event1 = ["01:00","02:00"], event2 = ["01:20","03:00"]
Output: true
Explanation: The two events intersect starting from 01:20 to 02:00.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: event1 = ["10:00","11:00"], event2 = ["14:00","15:00"]
Output: false
Explanation: The two events do not intersect.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```evnet1.length == event2.length == 2.```
	
- ```event1[i].length == event2[i].length == 5```
	
- ```startTime1 <= endTime1```
	
- ```startTime2 <= endTime2```
	
- All the event times follow the ```HH:MM``` format.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean haveConflict(String[] event1, String[] event2) {
        int c1 = event2[0].compareTo(event1[1]);
        int c2 = event2[1].compareTo(event1[0]);
        return (c1 <= 0) && (c2 >= 0);
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
