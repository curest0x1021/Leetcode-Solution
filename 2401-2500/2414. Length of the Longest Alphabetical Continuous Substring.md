## Problem

An **alphabetical continuous string** is a string consisting of consecutive letters in the alphabet. In other words, it is any substring of the string ```"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"```.


	
- For example, ```"abc"``` is an alphabetical continuous string, while ```"acb"``` and ```"za"``` are not.


Given a string ```s``` consisting of lowercase letters only, return the **length of the **longest** alphabetical continuous substring.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 4 distinct continuous substrings: "a", "b", "c" and "ab".
"ab" is the longest continuous substring.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: "abcde" is the longest continuous substring.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```s``` consists of only English lowercase letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestContinuousSubstring(String s) {
        int x = 0, len = 0, res = 0;
        for(char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            len = ch-'a'-x==1 ? len+1 : 1;  // add to len or restart
            res = Math.max(res, len);
            x = ch-'a';
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
