## Problem

Given two positive integers ```a``` and ```b```, return **the number of **common** factors of **```a```** and **```b```.

An integer ```x``` is a **common factor** of ```a``` and ```b``` if ```x``` divides both ```a``` and ```b```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 12, b = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 25, b = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= a, b <= 1000```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int commonFactors(int a, int b) {
        int s = 0;
        for(int i = 2; i <= Math.min(a, b)/2+1; i++){
            if(a % i == 0 && b % i == 0){
                ++s;
            }
        }
        if(a == 1 || b ==  1){
            return 1;
        }
        return a == b/2 || b == a/2 || a == b ? s+2:s+1;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
