## Problem

You are given a string of length ```5``` called ```time```, representing the current time on a digital clock in the format ```"hh:mm"```. The **earliest** possible time is ```"00:00"``` and the **latest** possible time is ```"23:59"```.

In the string ```time```, the digits represented by the ```?``` symbol are **unknown**, and must be **replaced** with a digit from ```0``` to ```9```.

Return** an integer **```answer```**, the number of valid clock times that can be created by replacing every **```?```** with a digit from **```0```** to **```9```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: time = "?5:00"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the ? with either a 0 or 1, producing "05:00" or "15:00". Note that we cannot replace it with a 2, since the time "25:00" is invalid. In total, we have two choices.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: time = "0?:0?"
Output: 100
Explanation: Each ? can be replaced by any digit from 0 to 9, so we have 100 total choices.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: time = "??:??"
Output: 1440
Explanation: There are 24 possible choices for the hours, and 60 possible choices for the minutes. In total, we have 24 * 60 = 1440 choices.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```time``` is a valid string of length ```5``` in the format ```"hh:mm"```.
	
- ```"00" <= hh <= "23"```
	
- ```"00" <= mm <= "59"```
	
- Some of the digits might be replaced with ```'?'``` and need to be replaced with digits from ```0``` to ```9```.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int countTime(String time) {
        if (time.equals("??:??")) return 24 * 60;
        int res = 1;

        if (time.charAt(0) == '?' && time.charAt(1) == '?') {
            res *= 24;
        } else if (time.charAt(0) == '?'){
            res *= (time.charAt(1) - '0' >= 4 ? 2 : 3);
        } else if (time.charAt(1) == '?'){
            res *= (time.charAt(0) - '0' >= 2 ? 4 : 10);
        }

        if (time.charAt(4) == '?') res *= 10;
        if (time.charAt(3) == '?') res *= 6;
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
