## Problem

There are ```n``` couples sitting in ```2n``` seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.

The people and seats are represented by an integer array ```row``` where ```row[i]``` is the ID of the person sitting in the ```ith``` seat. The couples are numbered in order, the first couple being ```(0, 1)```, the second couple being ```(2, 3)```, and so on with the last couple being ```(2n - 2, 2n - 1)```.

Return **the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side**. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: row = [0,2,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: row = [3,2,0,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All couples are already seated side by side.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2n == row.length```
	
- ```2 <= n <= 30```
	
- ```n``` is even.
	
- ```0 <= row[i] < 2n```
	
- All the elements of ```row``` are **unique**.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} row
 * @return {number}
 */
var minSwapsCouples = function(row) {
  const map = row.reduce((acc, num, index) => {
    acc[num] = index
    return acc
  }, {})
  const swap = (a, b) => {
    const indexA = map[a]
    const indexB = map[b]
    let temp = map[a]
    map[a] = map[b]
    map[b] = map[a]
    temp = row[indexA]
    row[indexA] = row[indexB]
    row[indexB] = temp
  }
  let count = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < row.length; i += 2) {
    if (row[i] % 2 === 0) {
      if (row[i + 1] !== row[i] + 1) {
        swap(row[i + 1], row[i] + 1)
        count += 1
      }
    } else if (row[i + 1] !== row[i] - 1) {
      swap(row[i + 1], row[i] - 1)
      count += 1
    }
  }
  return count
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
