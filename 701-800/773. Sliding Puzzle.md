## Problem

On an ```2 x 3``` board, there are five tiles labeled from ```1``` to ```5```, and an empty square represented by ```0```. A **move** consists of choosing ```0``` and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is ```[[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]```.

Given the puzzle board ```board```, return **the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved**. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return ```-1```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/slide2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/slide3-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
An example path:
After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```board.length == 2```
	
- ```board[i].length == 3```
	
- ```0 <= board[i][j] <= 5```
	
- Each value ```board[i][j]``` is **unique**.



## Solution

```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int slidingPuzzle(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
    constexpr int kRows = 2;
    constexpr int kCols = 3; 
    string goal;
    string start;
    for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); ++i)
      for (int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); ++j) {
        start += (board[i][j] + '0');
        goal += (i * kCols + j + 1) % (kRows * kCols) + '0'; // 12345...0
    }
    
    if (start == goal) return 0;
    
    constexpr int dirs[4][2] = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    
    set<string> visited{start};
    int steps = 0;
    queue<string> q;
    q.push(start);
    while (!q.empty()) {
      ++steps;
      int size = q.size();
      while (size-- > 0) {
        string s = q.front();
        q.pop();
        int p = s.find('0');
        int y = p / kCols;
        int x = p % kCols;        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
          int tx = x + dirs[i][0];
          int ty = y + dirs[i][1];
          if (tx < 0 || ty < 0 || tx >= kCols || ty >= kRows) continue;
          int pp = ty * kCols + tx;
          string t(s);
          swap(t[p], t[pp]);          
          if (visited.count(t)) continue;            
          if (t == goal) return steps;
          visited.insert(t);
          q.push(t);
        }
      }      
    }
    return -1;
  }
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
