## Problem

There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of ```n``` digits where each digit can be in the range ```[0, k - 1]```.

The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the **most recent **```n```** digits** that were entered each time you type a digit.


	For example, the correct password is ```"345"``` and you enter in ```"012345"```:

	
		
- After typing ```0```, the most recent ```3``` digits is ```"0"```, which is incorrect.
		
- After typing ```1```, the most recent ```3``` digits is ```"01"```, which is incorrect.
		
- After typing ```2```, the most recent ```3``` digits is ```"012"```, which is incorrect.
		
- After typing ```3```, the most recent ```3``` digits is ```"123"```, which is incorrect.
		
- After typing ```4```, the most recent ```3``` digits is ```"234"```, which is incorrect.
		
- After typing ```5```, the most recent ```3``` digits is ```"345"```, which is correct and the safe unlocks.
	
	


Return **any string of **minimum length** that will unlock the safe **at some point** of entering it**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1, k = 2
Output: "10"
Explanation: The password is a single digit, so enter each digit. "01" would also unlock the safe.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: "01100"
Explanation: For each possible password:
- "00" is typed in starting from the 4th digit.
- "01" is typed in starting from the 1st digit.
- "10" is typed in starting from the 3rd digit.
- "11" is typed in starting from the 2nd digit.
Thus "01100" will unlock the safe. "01100", "10011", and "11001" would also unlock the safe.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 4```
	
- ```1 <= k <= 10```
	
- ```1 <= kn <= 4096```


## Solution (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    private String foundStr;

    public String crackSafe(int n, int k) {
        int targetCnt = (int) Math.pow(k, n);
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[(int) Math.pow(10, n)];
        visited[0] = true;
        int visitedCnt = 1;
        StringBuilder crackStr = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            crackStr.append('0');
        }
        dfsAddPwd(n, k, crackStr, 0, visited, visitedCnt, targetCnt);
        return foundStr;
    }

    private void dfsAddPwd(
            int n,
            int k,
            StringBuilder crackStr,
            int prev,
            boolean[] visited,
            int visitedCnt,
            int targetCnt) {
        if (foundStr != null) {
            return;
        }
        if (visitedCnt == targetCnt) {
            foundStr = crackStr.toString();
            return;
        }
        int root = 10 * prev % ((int) Math.pow(10, n));
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int current = root + i;
            if (!visited[current]) {
                crackStr.append(i);
                visited[current] = true;
                dfsAddPwd(n, k, crackStr, current, visited, visitedCnt + 1, targetCnt);
                crackStr.setLength(crackStr.length() - 1);
                visited[current] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string crackSafe(int n, int k) {
        const int total_len = pow(k, n) + n - 1;
        string ans(n, '0');
        unordered_set<string> visited{ans};
        if (dfs(ans, total_len, n, k, visited))
            return ans;
        return "";
    }
private:
    bool dfs(string& ans, const int total_len, const int n, const int k, unordered_set<string>& visited) {
        if (ans.length() == total_len)
            return true;
        
        string node = ans.substr(ans.length() - n + 1, n - 1);
        for (char c = '0'; c < '0' + k; ++c) {
            node.push_back(c);
            if (!visited.count(node)) {
                ans.push_back(c);
                visited.insert(node);
                if (dfs(ans, total_len, n, k, visited)) return true;
                visited.erase(node);
                ans.pop_back();
            }
            node.pop_back();
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
