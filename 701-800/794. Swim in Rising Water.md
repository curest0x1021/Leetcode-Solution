## Problem

You are given an ```n x n``` integer matrix ```grid``` where each value ```grid[i][j]``` represents the elevation at that point ```(i, j)```.

The rain starts to fall. At time ```t```, the depth of the water everywhere is ```t```. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most ```t```. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return **the least time until you can reach the bottom right square **```(n - 1, n - 1)```** if you start at the top left square **```(0, 0)```.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/swim1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/swim2-grid-1.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == grid.length```
	
- ```n == grid[i].length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 50```
	
- ```0 <= grid[i][j] < n2```
	
- Each value ```grid[i][j]``` is **unique**.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
const moves = [[1,0],[0,1],[-1,0],[0,-1]]

var swimInWater = function(grid) {
    let pq = new MinPriorityQueue(),
        N = grid.length - 1, ans = grid[0][0], i = 0, j = 0
    while (i < N || j < N) {
        for (let [a,b] of moves) {
            let ia = i + a, jb = j + b
            if (ia < 0 || ia > N || jb < 0 || jb > N || grid[ia][jb] > 2500) continue
            pq.enqueue((grid[ia][jb] << 12) + (ia << 6) + jb)
            grid[ia][jb] = 3000
        }
        let next = pq.dequeue().element
        ans = Math.max(ans, next >> 12)
        i = (next >> 6) & ((1 << 6) - 1)
        j = next & ((1 << 6) - 1)
    }
    return ans
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
