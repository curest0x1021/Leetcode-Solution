## Problem

Given an array of strings ```words``` representing an English Dictionary, return **the longest word in** ```words``` **that can be built one character at a time by other words in** ```words```.

If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.

Note that the word should be built from left to right with each additional character being added to the end of a previous word. 

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= words.length <= 1000```
	
- ```1 <= words[i].length <= 30```
	
- ```words[i]``` consists of lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    private final Node root = new Node();
    private String longestWord = "";

    private static class Node {
        Node[] children;
        String str;

        public Node() {
            this.children = new Node[26];
            this.str = null;
        }

        public void insert(Node curr, String word) {
            for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
                char ch = word.charAt(i);
                if (curr.children[ch - 'a'] == null) {
                    curr.children[ch - 'a'] = new Node();
                }
                curr = curr.children[ch - 'a'];
            }
            curr.str = word;
        }
    }

    public String longestWord(String[] words) {
        for (String word : words) {
            root.insert(root, word);
        }
        dfs(root);
        return longestWord;
    }

    private void dfs(Node curr) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (curr.children[i] != null && curr.children[i].str != null) {
                if (curr.children[i].str.length() > longestWord.length()) {
                    longestWord = curr.children[i].str;
                }
                dfs(curr.children[i]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
