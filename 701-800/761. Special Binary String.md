## Problem

**Special binary strings** are binary strings with the following two properties:


	
- The number of ```0```'s is equal to the number of ```1```'s.
	
- Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many ```1```'s as ```0```'s.


You are given a **special binary** string ```s```.

A move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of ```s```, and swapping them. Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.

Return **the lexicographically largest resulting string possible after applying the mentioned operations on the string**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "11011000"
Output: "11100100"
Explanation: The strings "10" [occuring at s[1]] and "1100" [at s[3]] are swapped.
This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "10"
Output: "10"
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 50```
	
- ```s[i]``` is either ```'0'``` or ```'1'```.
	
- ```s``` is a special binary string.



## Solution

```C++
class Solution {
 public:
  string makeLargestSpecial(string S) {
    vector<string> specials;
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 0, j = 0; j < S.length(); ++j) {
      count += S[j] == '1' ? 1 : -1;
      if (count == 0) {  // find a special string
        const string& inner = S.substr(i + 1, j - i - 1);
        specials.push_back('1' + makeLargestSpecial(inner) + '0');
        i = j + 1;
      }
    }

    sort(begin(specials), end(specials), greater<>());
    return join(specials);
  }

 private:
  string join(const vector<string>& specials) {
    string joined;
    for (const string& special : specials)
      joined += special;
    return joined;
  }
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
