## Problem

You are given an ```n x n``` binary grid ```board```. In each move, you can swap any two rows with each other, or any two columns with each other.

Return **the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a **chessboard board****. If the task is impossible, return ```-1```.

A **chessboard board** is a board where no ```0```'s and no ```1```'s are 4-directionally adjacent.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/chessboard1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: One potential sequence of moves is shown.
The first move swaps the first and second column.
The second move swaps the second and third row.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/chessboard2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Also note that the board with 0 in the top left corner, is also a valid chessboard.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/chessboard3-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[1,0],[1,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No matter what sequence of moves you make, you cannot end with a valid chessboard.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == board.length```
	
- ```n == board[i].length```
	
- ```2 <= n <= 30```
	
- ```board[i][j]``` is either ```0``` or ```1```.



## Solution

```C++
class Solution {
public:
   int movesToChessboard(vector<vector<int>>& b) {
      int n = b.size();
      for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
         for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
            if(b[0][0] ^ b[0][j] ^ b[i][0] ^ b[i][j]) return -1;
         }
      }
      int rowSum = 0;
      int colSum = 0;
      int rowSwap = 0;
      int colSwap = 0;
      for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
         rowSum += b[i][0];
         colSum += b[0][i];
         rowSwap += b[i][0] == i % 2;
         colSwap += b[0][i] == i % 2;
      }
      if(rowSum != n/2 && rowSum != (n + 1)/2)return -1;
      if(colSum != n/2 && colSum != (n + 1)/2)return -1;
      if(n % 2 == 1){
         if(colSwap % 2) colSwap = n - colSwap;
         if(rowSwap % 2) rowSwap = n - rowSwap;
      }else{
         colSwap = min(colSwap, n - colSwap);
         rowSwap = min(rowSwap, n - rowSwap);
      }
      return (rowSwap + colSwap)/2;
   }
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
