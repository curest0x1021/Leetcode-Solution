## Problem

You are given an integer array ```nums```. In one operation, you can replace **any** element in ```nums``` with **any** integer.

```nums``` is considered **continuous** if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:


	
- All elements in ```nums``` are **unique**.
	
- The difference between the **maximum** element and the **minimum** element in ```nums``` equals ```nums.length - 1```.


For example, ```nums = [4, 2, 5, 3]``` is **continuous**, but ```nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]``` is **not continuous**.

Return **the **minimum** number of operations to make **```nums```** ******continuous****.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums is already continuous.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,5,6]
Output: 1
Explanation: One possible solution is to change the last element to 4.
The resulting array is [1,2,3,5,4], which is continuous.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,10,100,1000]
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible solution is to:
- Change the second element to 2.
- Change the third element to 3.
- Change the fourth element to 4.
The resulting array is [1,2,3,4], which is continuous.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 105```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 109```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        int duplicates = 0;
        int maxContinuous = 0;
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        while (end < n) {
            if (end > 0 && nums[end] == nums[end - 1]) {
                duplicates++;
            }
            while (nums[start] + n <= nums[end]) {
                start++;
                if (nums[start] == nums[start - 1]) {
                    duplicates--;
                }
            }
            maxContinuous = Math.max(maxContinuous, end - start + 1 - duplicates);
            end++;
        }
        return n - maxContinuous;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
