## Problem

You are given a string ```s``` consisting of ```n``` characters which are either ```'X'``` or ```'O'```.

A **move** is defined as selecting **three** **consecutive characters** of ```s``` and converting them to ```'O'```. Note that if a move is applied to the character ```'O'```, it will stay the **same**.

Return **the **minimum** number of moves required so that all the characters of **```s```** are converted to **```'O'```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "XXX"
Output: 1
Explanation: XXX -> OOO
We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "XXOX"
Output: 2
Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "OOOO"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no 'X's in s to convert.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```3 <= s.length <= 1000```
	
- ```s[i]``` is either ```'X'``` or ```'O'```.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumMoves(String s) {
        int r = 0;
        int i = 0;
        char[] sArray = s.toCharArray();
        while (i < sArray.length) {
            if (sArray[i] == 'X') {
                r++;
                i += 2;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return r;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
