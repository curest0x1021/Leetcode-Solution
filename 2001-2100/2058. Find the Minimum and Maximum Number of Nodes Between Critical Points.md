## Problem

A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as **either** a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.

A node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value **strictly greater** than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value **strictly smaller** than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists **both** a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list ```head```, return **an array of length 2 containing **```[minDistance, maxDistance]```** where **```minDistance```** is the **minimum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points and **```maxDistance```** is the **maximum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points. If there are **fewer** than two critical points, return **```[-1, -1]```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,1]
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a2.png)

```
Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: There are three critical points:
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/14/a5.png)

```
Input: head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
Output: [3,3]
Explanation: There are two critical points:
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range ```[2, 10^5]```.
	
- ```1 <= Node.val <= 10^5```



## Solution (Java)

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int[] nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(ListNode head) {
        ListNode p = head;
        ListNode c = p.next;
        ListNode n = c.next;
        int current = 1;
        int first = -1;
        int last = -1;
        int min = -1;
        while (n != null) {
            if ((c.val > p.val && c.val > n.val) || (c.val < p.val && c.val < n.val)) {
                if (first == -1) {
                    first = current;
                } else if (min == -1) {
                    min = current - last;
                } else {
                    min = Math.min(min, current - last);
                }
                last = current;
            }
            p = c;
            c = n;
            n = n.next;
            current++;
        }
        return new int[] {min, (last == first ? -1 : last - first)};
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
