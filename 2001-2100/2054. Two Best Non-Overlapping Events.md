## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array of ```events``` where ```events[i] = [startTimei, endTimei, valuei]```. The ```ith``` event starts at ```startTimei``` and ends at ```endTimei```, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of ```valuei```. You can choose **at most** **two** **non-overlapping** events to attend such that the sum of their values is **maximized**.

Return **this **maximum** sum.**

Note that the start time and end time is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends at the same time. More specifically, if you attend an event with end time ```t```, the next event must start at or after ```t + 1```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[2,4,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 for a sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/21/picture1.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a sum of 5.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/21/picture3.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,5,3],[1,5,1],[6,6,5]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Choose events 0 and 2 for a sum of 3 + 5 = 8.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= events.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```events[i].length == 3```
	
- ```1 <= startTimei <= endTimei <= 10^9```
	
- ```1 <= valuei <= 10^6```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxTwoEvents(int[][] events) {
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int[] max = new int[events.length];
        for (int i = events.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (i == events.length - 1) {
                max[i] = events[i][2];
            } else {
                max[i] = Math.max(events[i][2], max[i + 1]);
            }
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < events.length; i++) {
            int end = events[i][1];
            int left = i + 1;
            int right = events.length;
            while (left < right) {
                int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                if (events[mid][0] <= end) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid;
                }
            }
            int value = events[i][2];
            if (right >= 0 && right < events.length) {
                value += max[right];
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, value);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
