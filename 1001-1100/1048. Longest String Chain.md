## Problem

You are given an array of ```words``` where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

```wordA``` is a **predecessor** of ```wordB``` if and only if we can insert **exactly one** letter anywhere in ```wordA``` **without changing the order of the other characters** to make it equal to ```wordB```.


	
- For example, ```"abc"``` is a **predecessor** of ```"abac"```, while ```"cba"``` is not a **predecessor** of ```"bcad"```.


A **word chain**** **is a sequence of words ```[word1, word2, ..., wordk]``` with ```k >= 1```, where ```word1``` is a **predecessor** of ```word2```, ```word2``` is a **predecessor** of ```word3```, and so on. A single word is trivially a **word chain** with ```k == 1```.

Return **the **length** of the **longest possible word chain** with words chosen from the given list of **```words```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5
Explanation: All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.
["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= words.length <= 1000```
	
- ```1 <= words[i].length <= 16```
	
- ```words[i]``` only consists of lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestStrChain(String[] words) {
        List[] lenStr = new List[20];
        for (String word : words) {
            int len = word.length();
            if (lenStr[len] == null) {
                lenStr[len] = new ArrayList<String>();
            }
            lenStr[len].add(word);
        }
        Map<String, Integer> longest = new HashMap<>();
        int max = 0;
        for (String s : words) {
            max = Math.max(findLongest(s, lenStr, longest), max);
        }
        return max;
    }

    public int findLongest(String word, List<String>[] lenStr, Map<String, Integer> longest) {
        if (longest.containsKey(word)) {
            return longest.get(word);
        }
        int len = word.length();
        List<String> words = lenStr[len + 1];
        if (words == null) {
            longest.put(word, 1);
            return 1;
        }
        int max = 0;
        int i;
        int j;
        for (String w : words) {
            i = 0;
            j = 0;
            while (i < len && j - i <= 1) {
                if (word.charAt(i) == w.charAt(j++)) {
                    ++i;
                }
            }
            if (j - i <= 1) {
                max = Math.max(findLongest(w, lenStr, longest), max);
            }
        }
        ++max;
        longest.put(word, max);
        return max;
    }
}
```
