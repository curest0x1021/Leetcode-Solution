## Problem

There is a car with ```capacity``` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer ```capacity``` and an array ```trips``` where ```trips[i] = [numPassengersi, fromi, toi]``` indicates that the ```ith``` trip has ```numPassengersi``` passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are ```fromi``` and ```toi``` respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return ```true```** if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or **```false```** otherwise**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= trips.length <= 1000```
	
- ```trips[i].length == 3```
	
- ```1 <= numPassengersi <= 100```
	
- ```0 <= fromi < toi <= 1000```
	
- ```1 <= capacity <= 10^5```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
        int[] stops = new int[1001];
        for (int[] t : trips) {
            stops[t[1]] += t[0];
            stops[t[2]] -= t[0];
        }
        for (int i = 0; capacity >= 0 && i < 1001; ++i) {
            capacity -= stops[i];
        }
        return capacity >= 0;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
