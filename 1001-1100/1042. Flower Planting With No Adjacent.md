## Problem

You have ```n``` gardens, labeled from ```1``` to ```n```, and an array ```paths``` where ```paths[i] = [xi, yi]``` describes a bidirectional path between garden ```xi``` to garden ```yi```. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

All gardens have **at most 3** paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return ****any** such a choice as an array **```answer```**, where **```answer[i]```** is the type of flower planted in the **```(i+1)th```** garden. The flower types are denoted **```1```**, **```2```**, **```3```**, or **```4```**. It is guaranteed an answer exists.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation:
Gardens 1 and 2 have different types.
Gardens 2 and 3 have different types.
Gardens 3 and 1 have different types.
Hence, [1,2,3] is a valid answer. Other valid answers include [1,2,4], [1,4,2], and [3,2,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 10^4```
	
- ```0 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10^4```
	
- ```paths[i].length == 2```
	
- ```1 <= xi, yi <= n```
	
- ```xi != yi```
	
- Every garden has **at most 3** paths coming into or leaving it.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    private List<Integer>[] graph;
    private int[] color;
    private boolean[] visited;

    public int[] gardenNoAdj(int n, int[][] paths) {
        buildGraph(n, paths);
        this.color = new int[n];
        this.visited = new boolean[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(i);
            }
        }

        return color;
    }

    private void dfs(int at) {
        visited[at] = true;
        int used = 0;

        for (int to : graph[at]) {
            if (color[to] != 0) {
                used |= 1 << color[to] - 1;
            }
        }

        // use available color
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            if ((used & 1 << i) == 0) {
                color[at] = i + 1;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    private void buildGraph(int n, int[][] paths) {
        graph = new ArrayList[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        for (int[] path : paths) {
            int u = path[0] - 1;
            int v = path[1] - 1;
            graph[u].add(v);
            graph[v].add(u);
        }
    }
}
```
