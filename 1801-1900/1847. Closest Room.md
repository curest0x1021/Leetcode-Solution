## Problem

There is a hotel with ```n``` rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array ```rooms``` where ```rooms[i] = [roomIdi, sizei]``` denotes that there is a room with room number ```roomIdi``` and size equal to ```sizei```. Each ```roomIdi``` is guaranteed to be **unique**.

You are also given ```k``` queries in a 2D array ```queries``` where ```queries[j] = [preferredj, minSizej]```. The answer to the ```jth``` query is the room number ```id``` of a room such that:


	
- The room has a size of **at least** ```minSizej```, and
	
- ```abs(id - preferredj)``` is **minimized**, where ```abs(x)``` is the absolute value of ```x```.


If there is a **tie** in the absolute difference, then use the room with the **smallest** such ```id```. If there is **no such room**, the answer is ```-1```.

Return **an array **```answer```** of length **```k```** where **```answer[j]```** contains the answer to the **```jth```** query**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: rooms = [[2,2],[1,2],[3,2]], queries = [[3,1],[3,3],[5,2]]
Output: [3,-1,3]
Explanation: The answers to the queries are as follows:
Query = [3,1]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 3) = 0, and its size of 2 is at least 1. The answer is 3.
Query = [3,3]: There are no rooms with a size of at least 3, so the answer is -1.
Query = [5,2]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 5) = 2, and its size of 2 is at least 2. The answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rooms = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,5],[4,1],[5,2]], queries = [[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [2,1,3]
Explanation: The answers to the queries are as follows:
Query = [2,3]: Room number 2 is the closest as abs(2 - 2) = 0, and its size of 3 is at least 3. The answer is 2.
Query = [2,4]: Room numbers 1 and 3 both have sizes of at least 4. The answer is 1 since it is smaller.
Query = [2,5]: Room number 3 is the only room with a size of at least 5. The answer is 3.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == rooms.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 10^5```
	
- ```k == queries.length```
	
- ```1 <= k <= 10^4```
	
- ```1 <= roomIdi, preferredj <= 10^7```
	
- ```1 <= sizei, minSizej <= 10^7```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] closestRoom(int[][] rooms, int[][] queries) {
        int numRoom = rooms.length;
        int numQuery = queries.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < numQuery; i++) {
            queries[i] = new int[] {queries[i][0], queries[i][1], i};
        }
        Arrays.sort(rooms, (a, b) -> (a[1] != b[1] ? (a[1] - b[1]) : (a[0] - b[0])));
        Arrays.sort(queries, (a, b) -> (a[1] != b[1] ? (a[1] - b[1]) : (a[0] - b[0])));
        TreeSet<Integer> roomIds = new TreeSet<>();
        int[] result = new int[numQuery];
        int j = numRoom - 1;
        for (int i = numQuery - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int currRoomId = queries[i][0];
            int currRoomSize = queries[i][1];
            int currQueryIndex = queries[i][2];
            while (j >= 0 && rooms[j][1] >= currRoomSize) {
                roomIds.add(rooms[j--][0]);
            }
            if (roomIds.contains(currRoomId)) {
                result[currQueryIndex] = currRoomId;
                continue;
            }
            Integer nextRoomId = roomIds.higher(currRoomId);
            Integer prevRoomId = roomIds.lower(currRoomId);
            if (nextRoomId == null && prevRoomId == null) {
                result[currQueryIndex] = -1;
            } else if (nextRoomId == null) {
                result[currQueryIndex] = prevRoomId;
            } else if (prevRoomId == null) {
                result[currQueryIndex] = nextRoomId;
            } else {
                if ((currRoomId - prevRoomId) <= (nextRoomId - currRoomId)) {
                    result[currQueryIndex] = prevRoomId;
                } else {
                    result[currQueryIndex] = nextRoomId;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
