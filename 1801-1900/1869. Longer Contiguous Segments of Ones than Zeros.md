## Problem

Given a binary string ```s```, return ```true```** if the **longest** contiguous segment of **```1```'**s is **strictly longer** than the **longest** contiguous segment of **```0```'**s in **```s```, or return ```false```** otherwise**.


	
- For example, in ```s = "110100010"``` the longest continuous segment of ```1```s has length ```2```, and the longest continuous segment of ```0```s has length ```3```.


Note that if there are no ```0```'s, then the longest continuous segment of ```0```'s is considered to have a length ```0```. The same applies if there is no ```1```'s.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1101"
Output: true
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "1101"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 1: "1101"
The segment of 1s is longer, so return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "111000"
Output: false
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 3: "111000"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "111000"
The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "110100010"
Output: false
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "110100010"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "110100010"
The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 100```
	
- ```s[i]``` is either ```'0'``` or ```'1'```.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkZeroOnes(String s) {
        int zeroes = 0;
        int ones = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < s.length()) {
            int start = i;
            while (i < s.length() && s.charAt(i) == '0') {
                i++;
            }
            if (i > start) {
                zeroes = Math.max(zeroes, i - start);
            }
            start = i;
            while (i < s.length() && s.charAt(i) == '1') {
                i++;
            }
            if (i > start) {
                ones = Math.max(ones, i - start);
            }
        }
        return ones > zeroes;
    }
}
```
