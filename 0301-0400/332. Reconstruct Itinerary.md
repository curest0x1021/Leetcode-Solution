# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

## Problem

You are given a list of airline ```tickets``` where ```tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]``` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from ```"JFK"```, thus, the itinerary must begin with ```"JFK"```. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.


	
- For example, the itinerary ```["JFK", "LGA"]``` has a smaller lexical order than ```["JFK", "LGB"]```.


You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary1-graph.jpg)

```
Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= tickets.length <= 300```
	
- ```tickets[i].length == 2```
	
- ```fromi.length == 3```
	
- ```toi.length == 3```
	
- ```fromi``` and ```toi``` consist of uppercase English letters.
	
- ```fromi != toi```



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[][]} tickets
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var findItinerary = function(tickets) {
    const flight_paths = new Map();

    // This is what we will return, we always know we start at JFK.
    const flight_path_order = ["JFK"];

    tickets = tickets.sort(); // O(n^2);

    // Create the adjacency list.
    for (const [source, dest] of tickets) {
        let edges = [];
        if (flight_paths.has(source)) {
            edges = flight_paths.get(source);
        }
        edges.push(dest);
        flight_paths.set(source, edges);
    }

    // Depth first search.
    const depth_first_search = (city) => {
        // Have we already been to all the nodes?
        // Meaning we have visited all the tickets?
        if (flight_path_order.length === tickets.length + 1) return true;

        // Get the departures of flights from this city.
        // If their isn't any, we need to back track on this node
        // Because we know we have more flights to go and we have already
        // somehow visited our destination. Which is incorrect.
        const cities_to_go_to = flight_paths.get(city) || [];
        if (!cities_to_go_to.length) return false;

        // So we have other cities to go to from here.
        // Let's create a copy of those cities because we're going to
        // be dynamically adding and removing from that array. Something our
        // for loop wouldn't be able able to handle otherwise.
        const cities_copied = Array.from(cities_to_go_to);

        // Visit all connecting cities.
        for (const other_city of cities_copied) {
            // Add to our output, as we're doing this in topological sort
            flight_path_order.push(other_city);

            // Remove the city from the edges of the graph.
            // As we don't want to revisit it. Otherwise we would have a loop.
            // Note: we're passing this array by reference. So we don't need to re-set it.
            // We use shift here because we've done this in lexicographical order starting from
            // the beginning.
            cities_to_go_to.shift();

            // If it returns true, it mean's we've visited all cities
            // and that mean's we have nothing else to do.
            if (depth_first_search(other_city)) {
                return flight_path_order;
            } else {
                // BACKTRACKING!
                // We've visited the wrong city!
                // Undo our work here, as this is not the right city,
                // we need to revisit this city later on and not now.
                // What this does is visit all other cities
                // then backtrack on this city.
                flight_path_order.pop();
                cities_to_go_to.push(other_city);
            }
        }

        return false;
    };

    // Start at JFK airport
    return depth_first_search("JFK");
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
