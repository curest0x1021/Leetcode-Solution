## Problem

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from ```1``` to ```n```. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API ```int guess(int num)```, which returns three possible results:


	
- ```-1```: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. ```num > pick```).
	
- ```1```: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. ```num < pick```).
	
- ```0```: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. ```num == pick```).


Return **the number that I picked**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1```
	
- ```1 <= pick <= n```



## Solution

```java
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        return helper(1,n);
    }
    
    public int helper(int start, int end){
        if(start == end) return start;
        int mid = Math.toIntExact(((long)start+(long)end)/2);
        int r = 0;
        if(guess(mid) == 0) r = mid;
        else if(guess(mid) == 1) r = helper(mid+1, end);
        else if(guess(mid) == -1) r = helper(start, mid-1);
        return r;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
