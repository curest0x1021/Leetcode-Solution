## Problem

We define ```str = [s, n]``` as the string ```str``` which consists of the string ```s``` concatenated ```n``` times.


	
- For example, ```str == ["abc", 3] =="abcabcabc"```.


We define that string ```s1``` can be obtained from string ```s2``` if we can remove some characters from ```s2``` such that it becomes ```s1```.


	
- For example, ```s1 = "abc"``` can be obtained from ```s2 = "ab**dbe**c"``` based on our definition by removing the bolded underlined characters.


You are given two strings ```s1``` and ```s2``` and two integers ```n1``` and ```n2```. You have the two strings ```str1 = [s1, n1]``` and ```str2 = [s2, n2]```.

Return **the maximum integer **```m```** such that **```str = [str2, m]```** can be obtained from **```str1```.

 
**Example 1:**
```
Input: s1 = "acb", n1 = 4, s2 = "ab", n2 = 2
Output: 2
```**Example 2:**
```
Input: s1 = "acb", n1 = 1, s2 = "acb", n2 = 1
Output: 1
```
 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100```
	
- ```s1``` and ```s2``` consist of lowercase English letters.
	
- ```1 <= n1, n2 <= 106```



## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int getMaxRepetitions(string s1, int n1, string s2, int n2) {
        vector<int> repeatCount(s2.size() + 1, 0);
        unordered_map<int, int> lookup;
        int j = 0, count = 0;
        for (int k = 1; k <= n1; ++k) {
            for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); ++i) {
                if (s1[i] == s2[j]) {
                    j = (j + 1) % s2.size();
                    count += (j == 0);
                }
            }
            
            if (lookup.find(j) != lookup.end()) {  // cyclic
                int i = lookup[j];
                int prefixCount = repeatCount[i];
                int patternCount = (count - repeatCount[i]) * ((n1 - i) / (k - i));
                int suffixCount = repeatCount[i + (n1 - i) % (k - i)] - repeatCount[i];
                return (prefixCount + patternCount + suffixCount) / n2;
            }
            lookup[j] = k;
            repeatCount[k] = count;
        }
        return repeatCount[n1] / n2;  // not cyclic iff n1 <= s2
    }
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
