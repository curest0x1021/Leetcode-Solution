## Problem

Given a string ```s``` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return **the length of the **longest palindrome**** that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, ```"Aa"``` is not considered a palindrome here.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 2000```
	
- ```s``` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindrome(String s) {
        BitSet set = new BitSet(60);
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            set.flip(c - 'A');
        }
        if (set.isEmpty()) {
            return s.length();
        }
        return s.length() - set.cardinality() + 1;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
