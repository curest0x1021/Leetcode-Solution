## Problem

You are given a string ```s``` and an integer ```k```. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most ```k``` times.

Return **the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 105```
	
- ```s``` consists of only uppercase English letters.
	
- ```0 <= k <= s.length```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int len = s.length();
        int[] count = new int[256];
        char[] sArr = s.toCharArray();
        int currMax = 0;
        int maxLen = 0;
        char curr;
        while (right < len) {
            curr = sArr[right];
            count[curr]++;
            currMax = Math.max(currMax, count[curr]);
            if (right - left + 1 <= currMax + k) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
            }
            while (right - left + 1 > currMax + k) {
                curr = sArr[left];
                count[curr]--;
                left++;
            }
            right++;
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```
