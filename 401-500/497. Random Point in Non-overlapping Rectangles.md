## Problem

You are given an array of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles ```rects``` where ```rects[i] = [ai, bi, xi, yi]``` indicates that ```(ai, bi)``` is the bottom-left corner point of the ```ith``` rectangle and ```(xi, yi)``` is the top-right corner point of the ```ith``` rectangle. Design an algorithm to pick a random integer point inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangle.

Any integer point inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles should be equally likely to be returned.

**Note** that an integer point is a point that has integer coordinates.

Implement the ```Solution``` class:


	
- ```Solution(int[][] rects)``` Initializes the object with the given rectangles ```rects```.
	
- ```int[] pick()``` Returns a random integer point ```[u, v]``` inside the space covered by one of the given rectangles.


 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/24/lc-pickrandomrec.jpg)

```
Input
["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
[[[[-2, -2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 4, 6]]], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, [1, -2], [1, -1], [-1, -2], [-2, -2], [0, 0]]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([[-2, -2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 4, 6]]);
solution.pick(); // return [1, -2]
solution.pick(); // return [1, -1]
solution.pick(); // return [-1, -2]
solution.pick(); // return [-2, -2]
solution.pick(); // return [0, 0]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= rects.length <= 100```
	
- ```rects[i].length == 4```
	
- ```-109 <= ai < xi <= 109```
	
- ```-109 <= bi < yi <= 109```
	
- ```xi - ai <= 2000```
	
- ```yi - bi <= 2000```
	
- All the rectangles do not overlap.
	
- At most ```104``` calls will be made to ```pick```.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    private final int[] weights;
    private final int[][] rects;
    private final Random random;

    public Solution(int[][] rects) {
        this.weights = new int[rects.length];
        this.rects = rects;
        this.random = new Random();
        for (int i = 0; i < rects.length; i++) {
            int[] rect = rects[i];
            int count = (1 + rect[2] - rect[0]) * (1 + rect[3] - rect[1]);
            weights[i] = (i == 0 ? 0 : weights[i - 1]) + count;
        }
    }

    public int[] pick() {
        int picked = 1 + random.nextInt(weights[weights.length - 1]);
        int idx = findGreaterOrEqual(picked);
        return getRandomPoint(idx);
    }

    private int findGreaterOrEqual(int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = weights.length - 1;
        while (left + 1 < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (weights[mid] >= target) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return weights[left] >= target ? left : right;
    }

    private int[] getRandomPoint(int idx) {
        int[] r = rects[idx];
        int left = r[0];
        int right = r[2];
        int bot = r[1];
        int top = r[3];
        return new int[] {
            left + random.nextInt(right - left + 1), bot + random.nextInt(top - bot + 1)
        };
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(rects);
 * int[] param_1 = obj.pick();
 */
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
