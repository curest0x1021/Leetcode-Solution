## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** array `words` containing `n` strings.

Let's define a **join** operation `join(x, y)` between two strings `x` and `y` as concatenating them into `xy`. However, if the last character of `x` is equal to the first character of `y`, one of them is **deleted**.

For example `join("ab", "ba") = "aba"` and `join("ab", "cde") = "abcde"`.

You are to perform `n - 1` **join** operations. Let `str0 = words[0]`. Starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n - 1`, for the `ith` operation, you can do one of the following:

- Make `stri = join(stri - 1, words[i])`
- Make `stri = join(words[i], stri - 1)`

Your task is to **minimize** the length of `strn - 1`.

Return **an integer denoting the minimum possible length of** `strn - 1`.

Example 1:

```
Input: words = ["aa","ab","bc"]
Output: 4
Explanation: In this example, we can perform join operations in the following order to minimize the length of str2:
str0 = "aa"
str1 = join(str0, "ab") = "aab"
str2 = join(str1, "bc") = "aabc"
It can be shown that the minimum possible length of str2 is 4.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: words = ["ab","b"]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, str0 = "ab", there are two ways to get str1:
join(str0, "b") = "ab" or join("b", str0) = "bab".
The first string, "ab", has the minimum length. Hence, the answer is 2.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: words = ["aaa","c","aba"]
Output: 6
Explanation: In this example, we can perform join operations in the following order to minimize the length of str2:
str0 = "aaa"
str1 = join(str0, "c") = "aaac"
str2 = join("aba", str1) = "abaaac"
It can be shown that the minimum possible length of str2 is 6.
```



**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
- Each character in `words[i]` is an English lowercase letter

## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    Integer[][][] dp;
    private int solve(int i, int n, int ps, int pe, String[] words){
        // strategy is we have to just compare first and last
        // taking whole string make no sense


		if(i == n)
			return 0;

        // if present in dp
        if(dp[i][ps][pe] != null)
            return dp[i][ps][pe];


        String cur = words[i];

        int cs = cur.charAt(0)-'a';
        int ce = cur.charAt(cur.length()-1)-'a';

        // taking current word length two times for 2 next calls
        int len1 = cur.length();
        int len2 = cur.length();


        // compare middle ones
        if(pe == cs){
            len1--;     // if mid same del current words starting basically decrease length of current
        }

        if(ce == ps){
            len2--;     // if mid same del current words ending basically decrease length of current
        }


        // send two word
        int opt1 = solve(i+1, n, ps, ce, words)+len1;       // in this for next call prev+cur so ps is starting ce is ending
        int opt2 = solve(i+1, n, cs, pe, words)+len2;       // cur+prev so cs is starting and pe is ending

        return dp[i][ps][pe] = Math.min(opt1, opt2);
    }

    public int minimizeConcatenatedLength(String[] words) {

        int n = words.length;
        if(n == 1)
            return words[0].length();
        dp = new Integer[n+1][26][26];

        int ps = (int)(words[0].charAt(0)-'a');
        int pe = (int)(words[0].charAt(words[0].length()-1)-'a');
        int len = words[0].length();

        return solve(1, n, ps, pe, words)+len;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

- Time complexity : O(n).
- Space complexity : O(n).
