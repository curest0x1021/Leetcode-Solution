## Problem

You are given an integer array ```jobs```, where ```jobs[i]``` is the amount of time it takes to complete the ```ith``` job.

There are ```k``` workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to **exactly** one worker. The **working time** of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the **maximum working time** of any worker is **minimized**.

**Return the **minimum** possible **maximum working time** of any assignment. **

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: jobs = [3,2,3], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: By assigning each person one job, the maximum time is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: jobs = [1,2,4,7,8], k = 2
Output: 11
Explanation: Assign the jobs the following way:
Worker 1: 1, 2, 8 (working time = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11)
Worker 2: 4, 7 (working time = 4 + 7 = 11)
The maximum working time is 11.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12```
	
- ```1 <= jobs[i] <= 10^7```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    private int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    public int minimumTimeRequired(int[] jobs, int k) {
        backtraking(jobs, jobs.length - 1, new int[k]);
        return min;
    }

    private void backtraking(int[] jobs, int j, int[] sum) {
        int max = getMax(sum);
        if (max >= min) {
            return;
        }
        if (j < 0) {
            min = max;
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < sum.length; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && sum[i] == sum[i - 1]) {
                continue;
            }
            sum[i] += jobs[j];
            backtraking(jobs, j - 1, sum);
            sum[i] -= jobs[j];
        }
    }

    private int getMax(int[] sum) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int j : sum) {
            max = Math.max(max, j);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
