## Problem

You are given an integer array ```nums``` and an integer ```goal```.

You want to choose a subsequence of ```nums``` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to ```goal```. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is ```sum```, then you want to **minimize the absolute difference** ```abs(sum - goal)```.

Return **the **minimum** possible value of** ```abs(sum - goal)```.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements **(possibly all or none)** of the original array.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5
Output: 1
Explanation: Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.
The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], goal = -7
Output: 7
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 40```
	
- ```-10^7 <= nums[i] <= 10^7```
	
- ```-10^9 <= goal <= 10^9```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    private int idx;
    private int sum;

    public int minAbsDifference(int[] nums, int goal) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int nFirst = (int) Math.pow(2, (double) n / 2);
        int nSecond = (int) Math.pow(2, n - n / 2);
        int[] first = new int[nFirst];
        int[] second = new int[nSecond];
        helper(nums, first, 0, n / 2 - 1);
        idx = sum = 0;
        helper(nums, second, n / 2, n - 1);
        Arrays.sort(first);
        Arrays.sort(second);
        int low = 0;
        int high = nSecond - 1;
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (low < nFirst && high >= 0) {
            int localSum = first[low] + second[high];
            ans = Math.min(ans, Math.abs(localSum - goal));
            if (ans == 0) {
                break;
            }
            if (localSum < goal) {
                low++;
            } else {
                high--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private void helper(int[] nums, int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
            arr[idx++] = sum;
            helper(nums, arr, i + 1, end);
            sum -= nums[i];
        }
    }
}
```
