# 1702. Maximum Binary String After Change

- Difficulty: Medium.
- Related Topics: String, Greedy.
- Similar Questions: Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K.

## Problem

You are given a binary string ```binary``` consisting of only ```0```'s or ```1```'s. You can apply each of the following operations any number of times:


	Operation 1: If the number contains the substring ```"00"```, you can replace it with ```"10"```.

	
		
- For example, ```"00010" -> "10010```"
	
	
	Operation 2: If the number contains the substring ```"10"```, you can replace it with ```"01"```.
	
		
- For example, ```"00010" -> "00001"```
	
	


**Return the **maximum binary string** you can obtain after any number of operations. Binary string ```x``` is greater than binary string ```y``` if ```x```'s decimal representation is greater than ```y```'s decimal representation.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: binary = "000110"
Output: "111011"
Explanation: A valid transformation sequence can be:
"000110" -> "000101" 
"000101" -> "100101" 
"100101" -> "110101" 
"110101" -> "110011" 
"110011" -> "111011"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: binary = "01"
Output: "01"
Explanation: "01" cannot be transformed any further.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= binary.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```binary``` consist of ```'0'``` and ```'1'```.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public String maximumBinaryString(String binary) {
        char[] bs = binary.toCharArray();
        int zcount = 0;
        int pos = -1;
        for (int i = bs.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (bs[i] == '0') {
                bs[i] = '1';
                zcount++;
                pos = i;
            }
        }
        if (pos >= 0) {
            bs[pos + zcount - 1] = '0';
        }
        return new String(bs);
    }
}
```
