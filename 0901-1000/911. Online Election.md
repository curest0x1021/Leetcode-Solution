## Problem

You are given two integer arrays ```persons``` and ```times```. In an election, the ```ith``` vote was cast for ```persons[i]``` at time ```times[i]```.

For each query at a time ```t```, find the person that was leading the election at time ```t```. Votes cast at time ```t``` will count towards our query. In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

Implement the ```TopVotedCandidate``` class:


	
- ```TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times)``` Initializes the object with the ```persons``` and ```times``` arrays.
	
- ```int q(int t)``` Returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time ```t``` according to the mentioned rules.


 
**Example 1:**

```
Input
["TopVotedCandidate", "q", "q", "q", "q", "q", "q"]
[[[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]], [3], [12], [25], [15], [24], [8]]
Output
[null, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TopVotedCandidate topVotedCandidate = new TopVotedCandidate([0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]);
topVotedCandidate.q(3); // return 0, At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
topVotedCandidate.q(12); // return 1, At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
topVotedCandidate.q(25); // return 1, At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
topVotedCandidate.q(15); // return 0
topVotedCandidate.q(24); // return 0
topVotedCandidate.q(8); // return 1

```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= persons.length <= 5000```
	
- ```times.length == persons.length```
	
- ```0 <= persons[i] < persons.length```
	
- ```0 <= times[i] <= 109```
	
- ```times``` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
	
- ```times[0] <= t <= 109```
	
- At most ```104``` calls will be made to ```q```.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class TopVotedCandidate {
    private final int[] times;
    private final int[] winnersAtTimeT;

    public TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) {
        this.times = times;
        this.winnersAtTimeT = new int[times.length];
        int[] counterArray = new int[persons.length];
        int maxVote = 0;
        int maxVotedPerson = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < persons.length; i++) {
            int person = persons[i];
            int voteCount = counterArray[person];
            if (voteCount + 1 >= maxVote) {
                maxVote = voteCount + 1;
                maxVotedPerson = person;
            }
            winnersAtTimeT[i] = maxVotedPerson;
            counterArray[persons[i]] = voteCount + 1;
        }
    }

    public int q(int t) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = times.length - 1;
        if (t >= times[hi]) {
            lo = hi;
        } else {
            while (lo < hi - 1) {
                int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
                if (times[mid] == t) {
                    lo = mid;
                    break;
                } else if (times[mid] > t) {
                    hi = mid;
                } else {
                    lo = mid;
                }
            }
        }
        return winnersAtTimeT[lo];
    }
}

/**
 * Your TopVotedCandidate object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TopVotedCandidate obj = new TopVotedCandidate(persons, times);
 * int param_1 = obj.q(t);
 */
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
