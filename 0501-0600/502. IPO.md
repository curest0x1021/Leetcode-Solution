## Problem

Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most ```k``` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most ```k``` distinct projects.

You are given ```n``` projects where the ```ith``` project has a pure profit ```profits[i]``` and a minimum capital of ```capital[i]``` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have ```w``` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of **at most** ```k``` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return **the final maximized capital**.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
Output: 6
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= k <= 105```
	
- ```0 <= w <= 109```
	
- ```n == profits.length```
	
- ```n == capital.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 105```
	
- ```0 <= profits[i] <= 104```
	
- ```0 <= capital[i] <= 109```

## Solution (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> minCapital =
                new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt((int[] a) -> a[1]));
        PriorityQueue<int[]> maxProfit = new PriorityQueue<>((int[] a, int[] b) -> b[0] - a[0]);
        for (int i = 0; i < profits.length; i++) {
            if (w >= capital[i]) {
                maxProfit.offer(new int[] {profits[i], capital[i]});
            } else {
                minCapital.offer(new int[] {profits[i], capital[i]});
            }
        }
        int count = 0;
        while (count < k && !maxProfit.isEmpty()) {
            int[] temp = maxProfit.poll();
            w += temp[0];
            count += 1;
            while (!minCapital.isEmpty() && minCapital.peek()[1] <= w) {
                maxProfit.offer(minCapital.poll());
            }
        }
        return w;
    }
}
```

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int W, vector<int>& Profits, vector<int>& Capital) {    
    priority_queue<int> doable;         // sorted by profit high to low.
    multiset<pair<int, int>> undoable;  // {capital, profit}
    for (int i = 0; i < Profits.size(); ++i) {
      if (Profits[i] <= 0) continue;
      if (Capital[i] <= W) 
        doable.push(Profits[i]);
      else
        undoable.emplace(Capital[i], Profits[i]);
    }
    auto it = undoable.cbegin();
    while (!doable.empty() && k--) {
      W += doable.top(); doable.pop();      
      while (it != undoable.cend() && it->first <= W)
        doable.push(it++->second);      
    }
    return W;
  }
};
```
