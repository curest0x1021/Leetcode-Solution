## Problem

Suppose you have ```n``` integers labeled ```1``` through ```n```. A permutation of those ```n``` integers ```perm``` (**1-indexed**) is considered a **beautiful arrangement** if for every ```i``` (```1 <= i <= n```), **either** of the following is true:


	
- ```perm[i]``` is divisible by ```i```.
	
- ```i``` is divisible by ```perm[i]```.


Given an integer ```n```, return **the **number** of the **beautiful arrangements** that you can construct**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first beautiful arrangement is [1,2]:
    - perm[1] = 1 is divisible by i = 1
    - perm[2] = 2 is divisible by i = 2
The second beautiful arrangement is [2,1]:
    - perm[1] = 2 is divisible by i = 1
    - i = 2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 15```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int countArrangement(int n) {
        return backtrack(n, n, new Integer[1 << (n + 1)], 0);
    }

    private int backtrack(int n, int index, Integer[] cache, int cacheindex) {
        if (index == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        int result = 0;
        if (cache[cacheindex] != null) {
            return cache[cacheindex];
        }
        for (int i = n; i > 0; i--) {
            if ((cacheindex & (1 << i)) == 0 && (i % (index) == 0 || (index) % i == 0)) {
                result += backtrack(n, index - 1, cache, cacheindex | 1 << i);
            }
        }
        cache[cacheindex] = result;
        return result;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
