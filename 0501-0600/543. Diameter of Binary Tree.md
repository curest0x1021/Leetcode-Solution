## Problem

Given the ```root``` of a binary tree, return **the length of the **diameter** of the tree**.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the ```root```.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range ```[1, 104]```.
	
- ```-100 <= Node.val <= 100```



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var diameterOfBinaryTree = function(root) {
    let diameter = 0;
    dfs(root);
    return diameter;

    function dfs(node) {
        if (!node) return 0;

        const left = dfs(node.left);
        const right = dfs(node.right);

        // update diameter at every node
        diameter = Math.max(diameter, left + right);

        // update the max path of the current node
        // 1 is the height of the node itself + longest path of children
        return 1 + Math.max(left, right);
    }
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
