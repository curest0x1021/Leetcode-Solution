## Problem

You are given an ```m x n``` matrix ```M``` initialized with all ```0```'s and an array of operations ```ops```, where ```ops[i] = [ai, bi]``` means ```M[x][y]``` should be incremented by one for all ```0 <= x < ai``` and ```0 <= y < bi```.

Count and return **the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations**.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/ex1.jpg)

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = []
Output: 9
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= m, n <= 4 * 10^4```
	
- ```0 <= ops.length <= 10^4```
	
- ```ops[i].length == 2```
	
- ```1 <= ai <= m```
	
- ```1 <= bi <= n```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    /*
     * Since the incrementing starts from zero to op[0] and op[1], we only need to find the range that
     * has the most overlaps. Thus we keep finding the minimum of both x and y.
     */
    public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
        int x = m;
        int y = n;
        for (int[] op : ops) {
            x = Math.min(x, op[0]);
            y = Math.min(y, op[1]);
        }
        return x * y;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
