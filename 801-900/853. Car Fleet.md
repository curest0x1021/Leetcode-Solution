## Problem

There are ```n``` cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is ```target``` miles away.

You are given two integer array ```position``` and ```speed```, both of length ```n```, where ```position[i]``` is the position of the ```ith``` car and ```speed[i]``` is the speed of the ```ith``` car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper **at the same speed**. The faster car will **slow down** to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A **car fleet** is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return **the **number of car fleets** that will arrive at the destination**.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.
Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == position.length == speed.length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 105```
	
- ```0 < target <= 106```
	
- ```0 <= position[i] < target```
	
- All the values of ```position``` are **unique**.
	
- ```0 < speed[i] <= 106```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    private static class Car {
        int position;
        int speed;
    }

    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {
        List<Car> cars = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < position.length; i++) {
            Car c = new Car();
            c.position = position[i];
            c.speed = speed[i];
            cars.add(c);
        }
        cars.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(c -> c.position));
        int numFleets = 1;
        float lastTime =
                ((float) (target - cars.get(cars.size() - 1).position))
                        / (cars.get(cars.size() - 1).speed);
        for (int i = cars.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            float timeToTarget = ((float) (target - cars.get(i).position)) / (cars.get(i).speed);
            if (timeToTarget > lastTime) {
                numFleets++;
                lastTime = timeToTarget;
            }
        }
        return numFleets;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
