## Problem

You are given an integer ```n``` and an array of **unique** integers ```blacklist```. Design an algorithm to pick a random integer in the range ```[0, n - 1]``` that is **not** in ```blacklist```. Any integer that is in the mentioned range and not in ```blacklist``` should be **equally likely** to be returned.

Optimize your algorithm such that it minimizes the number of calls to the **built-in** random function of your language.

Implement the ```Solution``` class:


	
- ```Solution(int n, int[] blacklist)``` Initializes the object with the integer ```n``` and the blacklisted integers ```blacklist```.
	
- ```int pick()``` Returns a random integer in the range ```[0, n - 1]``` and not in ```blacklist```.


 
**Example 1:**

```
Input
["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
[[7, [2, 3, 5]], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, 0, 4, 1, 6, 1, 0, 4]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution(7, [2, 3, 5]);
solution.pick(); // return 0, any integer from [0,1,4,6] should be ok. Note that for every call of pick,
                 // 0, 1, 4, and 6 must be equally likely to be returned (i.e., with probability 1/4).
solution.pick(); // return 4
solution.pick(); // return 1
solution.pick(); // return 6
solution.pick(); // return 1
solution.pick(); // return 0
solution.pick(); // return 4
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= n <= 109```
	
- ```0 <= blacklist.length <= min(105, n - 1)```
	
- ```0 <= blacklist[i] < n```
	
- All the values of ```blacklist``` are **unique**.
	
- At most ```2 * 104``` calls will be made to ```pick```.



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    int M; //M is the number of integers from [0, N) which not in blacklist
    Random r;
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map;

    public Solution(int N, int[] blacklist) {
        map = new HashMap<>();
        r = new Random();
        for (int b: blacklist) {
            map.put(b, -1);
        }
        
        M = N - map.size();
        
        for (int b: blacklist) {
            if (b < M) {
                while (map.containsKey(N - 1)) {
                    N--;
                }
                map.put(b, N - 1);//remaping b to N-1, so the key will be the element in blacklist, and the value will be the number it remapping. so each time we choose a one, we check if we need to remapping, if we need to remaping, then we do it. if it is not, then we use it.
                //this mechanism actually avoid that possiblity discard the random number rach time, it is genius
                N--;
            }
        }
    }
    
    public int pick() {
        int p = r.nextInt(M); //choose any integer from [0, M)
        if (map.containsKey(p)) { //if p is contained in map, then remapping it 
            return map.get(p);
            
        }
        return p;
    }
}

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution obj = new Solution(n, blacklist);
 * int param_1 = obj.pick();
 */
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
