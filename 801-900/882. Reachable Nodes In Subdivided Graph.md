## Problem

You are given an undirected graph (the **"original graph"**) with ```n``` nodes labeled from ```0``` to ```n - 1```. You decide to **subdivide** each edge in the graph into a chain of nodes, with the number of new nodes varying between each edge.

The graph is given as a 2D array of ```edges``` where ```edges[i] = [ui, vi, cnti]``` indicates that there is an edge between nodes ```ui``` and ```vi``` in the original graph, and ```cnti``` is the total number of new nodes that you will **subdivide** the edge into. Note that ```cnti == 0``` means you will not subdivide the edge.

To **subdivide** the edge ```[ui, vi]```, replace it with ```(cnti + 1)``` new edges and ```cnti``` new nodes. The new nodes are ```x1```, ```x2```, ..., ```xcnti```, and the new edges are ```[ui, x1]```, ```[x1, x2]```, ```[x2, x3]```, ..., ```[xcnti-1, xcnti]```, ```[xcnti, vi]```.

In this **new graph**, you want to know how many nodes are **reachable** from the node ```0```, where a node is **reachable** if the distance is ```maxMoves``` or less.

Given the original graph and ```maxMoves```, return **the number of nodes that are **reachable** from node **```0```** in the new graph**.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/08/01/origfinal.png)

```
Input: edges = [[0,1,10],[0,2,1],[1,2,2]], maxMoves = 6, n = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: The edge subdivisions are shown in the image above.
The nodes that are reachable are highlighted in yellow.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,2,8],[1,3,1]], maxMoves = 10, n = 4
Output: 23
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: edges = [[1,2,4],[1,4,5],[1,3,1],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]], maxMoves = 17, n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: Node 0 is disconnected from the rest of the graph, so only node 0 is reachable.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```0 <= edges.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 104)```
	
- ```edges[i].length == 3```
	
- ```0 <= ui < vi < n```
	
- There are **no multiple edges** in the graph.
	
- ```0 <= cnti <= 104```
	
- ```0 <= maxMoves <= 109```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 3000```



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int reachableNodes(int[][] edges, int maxMoves, int n) {
        // Build graph
        List<int[]>[] graph = new List[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            // how many nodes between u and v(inclusive)
            // vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            int w = edge[2] + 1;
            graph[u].add(new int[] {v, w});
            graph[v].add(new int[] {u, w});
        }
        // Do dijkstra
        Queue<int[]> queue = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
        int[] dist = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE >> 1);
        dist[0] = 0;
        queue.add(new int[] {0, dist[0]});
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = queue.poll();
            int u = curr[0];
            int d = curr[1];
            if (d != dist[u]) {
                continue;
            }
            for (int[] next : graph[u]) {
                int v = next[0];
                int w = next[1];
                if (dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                    queue.add(new int[] {v, dist[v]});
                }
            }
        }
        // Count reachable nodes
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (dist[i] <= maxMoves) {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            int w = edge[2];
            // Nodes can be extended from (u, v) in at most maxMoves steps
            // if maxMoves - dist[u] < 0, then l = 0
            int l = Math.max(0, maxMoves - dist[u]);
            int r = Math.max(0, maxMoves - dist[v]);
            // l + r shouldn't be greater than w
            ans += Math.min(w, l + r);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
