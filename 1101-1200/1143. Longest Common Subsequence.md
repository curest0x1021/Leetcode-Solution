## Problem

Given two strings ```text1``` and ```text2```, return **the length of their longest **common subsequence**. **If there is no **common subsequence**, return ```0```.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.


	
- For example, ```"ace"``` is a subsequence of ```"abcde"```.


A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000```
	
- ```text1``` and ```text2``` consist of only lowercase English characters.


## Solution (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int n = text1.length();
        int m = text2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][m + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    }
}
```

## Solution (Javascript)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} text1
 * @param {string} text2
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestCommonSubsequence = function(text1, text2) {
    // Create dp table
    const dp = Array(text1.length+1).fill(0).map(() => Array(text2.length+1).fill(0))
    for(let i = 1; i < dp.length; i++) {
        for(let j = 1; j < dp[i].length; j++) {
            // If the letters match, look diagonally to get the max subsequence before this letter and add one
            if(text1[i-1]===text2[j-1]){
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            } else {
                // If there is no match, set the cell to the previous current longest subsequence
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j])
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[text1.length][text2.length]
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
