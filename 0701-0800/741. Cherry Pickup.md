## Problem

You are given an ```n x n``` ```grid``` representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.


	
- ```0``` means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
	
- ```1``` means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
	
- ```-1``` means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.


Return **the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below**:


	
- Starting at the position ```(0, 0)``` and reaching ```(n - 1, n - 1)``` by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value ```0``` or ```1```).
	
- After reaching ```(n - 1, n - 1)```, returning to ```(0, 0)``` by moving left or up through valid path cells.
	
- When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell ```0```.
	
- If there is no valid path between ```(0, 0)``` and ```(n - 1, n - 1)```, then no cherries can be collected.


 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/14/grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,-1],[1,0,-1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,-1],[1,-1,1],[-1,1,1]]
Output: 0
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == grid.length```
	
- ```n == grid[i].length```
	
- ```1 <= n <= 50```
	
- ```grid[i][j]``` is ```-1```, ```0```, or ```1```.
	
- ```grid[0][0] != -1```
	
- ```grid[n - 1][n - 1] != -1```


## Solution (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    public int cherryPickup(int[][] grid) {
        int[][][] dp = new int[grid.length][grid.length][grid.length];
        int ans = solve(0, 0, 0, grid, dp);
        return Math.max(ans, 0);
    }

    private int solve(int r1, int c1, int r2, int[][] arr, int[][][] dp) {
        int c2 = r1 + c1 - r2;
        if (r1 >= arr.length
                || r2 >= arr.length
                || c1 >= arr[0].length
                || c2 >= arr[0].length
                || arr[r1][c1] == -1
                || arr[r2][c2] == -1) {
            return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        }

        if (r1 == arr.length - 1 && c1 == arr[0].length - 1) {
            return arr[r1][c1];
        }

        if (dp[r1][c1][r2] != 0) {
            return dp[r1][c1][r2];
        }

        int cherries = 0;
        if (r1 == r2 && c1 == c2) {
            cherries += arr[r1][c1];
        } else {
            cherries += arr[r1][c1] + arr[r2][c2];
        }

        int a = solve(r1, c1 + 1, r2, arr, dp);
        int b = solve(r1 + 1, c1, r2 + 1, arr, dp);
        int c = solve(r1, c1 + 1, r2 + 1, arr, dp);
        int d = solve(r1 + 1, c1, r2, arr, dp);

        cherries += Math.max(Math.max(a, b), Math.max(c, d));
        dp[r1][c1][r2] = cherries;
        return cherries;
    }
}
```

        return max(0, dp(n - 1, n - 1, n - 1));
    }

    int dp(int x1, int y1, int x2) {
        const int y2 = x1 + y1 - x2;
        if (x1 < 0 || y1 < 0 || x2 < 0 || y2 < 0) return -1;
        if ((*grid_)[y1][x1] < 0 || (*grid_)[y2][x2] < 0) return -1;

        if (m_[x1][y1][x2] != INT_MIN) return m_[x1][y1][x2];        
        int ans =  max(max(dp(x1 - 1, y1, x2 - 1), dp(x1, y1 - 1, x2)),
                       max(dp(x1, y1 - 1, x2 - 1), dp(x1 - 1, y1, x2)));
        if (ans < 0) return m_[x1][y1][x2] = -1;
        ans += (*grid_)[y1][x1];
        if (x1 != x2) ans += (*grid_)[y2][x2];
        
        return m_[x1][y1][x2] = ans;
    }
    
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> m_;
    vector<vector<int>>* grid_; // does not own the object
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
