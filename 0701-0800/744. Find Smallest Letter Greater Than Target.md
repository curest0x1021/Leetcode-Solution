## Problem

Given a characters array ```letters``` that is sorted in **non-decreasing** order and a character ```target```, return **the smallest character in the array that is larger than **```target```.

**Note** that the letters wrap around.


	
- For example, if ```target == 'z'``` and ```letters == ['a', 'b']```, the answer is ```'a'```.


 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
Output: "f"
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= letters.length <= 10^4```
	
- ```letters[i]``` is a lowercase English letter.
	
- ```letters``` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
	
- ```letters``` contains at least two different characters.
	
- ```target``` is a lowercase English letter.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = letters.length - 1;
        // If target is greater than last element return first element of the array.
        if (letters[letters.length - 1] <= target) {
            return letters[start];
        }
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (letters[mid] <= target) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return letters[start];
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
