## Problem

There is a **directed** graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n` directed edges.

You are given a **0-indexed** array `edges` where `edges[i]` indicates that there is an edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`.

Consider the following process on the graph:

- You start from a node `x` and keep visiting other nodes through edges until you reach a node that you have already visited before on this **same** process.

Return **an array **`answer`** where **`answer[i]`** is the number of **different** nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node **`i`.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/31/graaphdrawio-1.png)

```
Input: edges = [1,2,0,0]
Output: [3,3,3,4]
Explanation: We perform the process starting from each node in the following way:
- Starting from node 0, we visit the nodes 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
- Starting from node 1, we visit the nodes 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
- Starting from node 2, we visit the nodes 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
- Starting from node 3, we visit the nodes 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 4.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/31/graaph2drawio.png)

```
Input: edges = [1,2,3,4,0]
Output: [5,5,5,5,5]
Explanation: Starting from any node we can visit every node in the graph in the process.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == edges.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= edges[i] <= n - 1`
- `edges[i] != i`

## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countVisitedNodes(List<Integer> edges) {
        int n = edges.size(), res[] = new int[n], j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; j = ++i) {
            Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
            Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();
            while (!seen.contains(j) && res[j] == 0) {
                seen.add(j);
                s.push(j);
                j = edges.get(j);
            }
            if (seen.contains(j)) { // hit the cycle
                int k = s.size() - s.indexOf(j);
                for (j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
                    res[s.pop()] = k;
                }
            }
            while (!s.isEmpty()) {
                j = s.pop();
                res[j] = res[edges.get(j)] + 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

- Time complexity : O(n).
- Space complexity : O(n).
