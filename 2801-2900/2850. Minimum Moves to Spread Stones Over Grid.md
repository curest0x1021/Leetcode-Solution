## Problem

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `3 * 3`, representing the number of stones in each cell. The grid contains exactly `9` stones, and there can be **multiple** stones in a single cell.

In one move, you can move a single stone from its current cell to any other cell if the two cells share a side.

Return **the **minimum number of moves** required to place one stone in each cell**.

Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,0],[1,1,1],[1,2,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible sequence of moves to place one stone in each cell is:
1- Move one stone from cell (2,1) to cell (2,2).
2- Move one stone from cell (2,2) to cell (1,2).
3- Move one stone from cell (1,2) to cell (0,2).
In total, it takes 3 moves to place one stone in each cell of the grid.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of moves required to place one stone in each cell.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/08/23/example2-2.svg)

```
Input: grid = [[1,3,0],[1,0,0],[1,0,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible sequence of moves to place one stone in each cell is:
1- Move one stone from cell (0,1) to cell (0,2).
2- Move one stone from cell (0,1) to cell (1,1).
3- Move one stone from cell (2,2) to cell (1,2).
4- Move one stone from cell (2,2) to cell (2,1).
In total, it takes 4 moves to place one stone in each cell of the grid.
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of moves required to place one stone in each cell.
```

**Constraints:**

- `grid.length == grid[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 9`
- Sum of `grid` is equal to `9`.

## Solution (Java)

```java
import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
    public int minimumMoves(int[][] grid) {
        // Base Case
        int t = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j)
                if (grid[i][j] == 0)
                    t++;
        if (t == 0)
            return 0;

        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    for (int ni = 0; ni < 3; ++ni) {
                        for (int nj = 0; nj < 3; ++nj) {
                            int d = Math.abs(ni - i) + Math.abs(nj - j);
                            if (grid[ni][nj] > 1) {
                                grid[ni][nj]--;
                                grid[i][j]++;
                                ans = Math.min(ans, d + minimumMoves(grid));
                                grid[ni][nj]++;
                                grid[i][j]--;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**
