# 2842. Count K-Subsequences of a String With Maximum Beauty

## Problem

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

A **k-subsequence** is a **subsequence** of `s`, having length `k`, and all its characters are **unique**, **i.e**., every character occurs once.

Let `f(c)` denote the number of times the character `c` occurs in `s`.

The **beauty** of a **k-subsequence** is the **sum** of `f(c)` for every character `c` in the k-subsequence.

For example, consider `s = "abbbdd"` and `k = 2`:

- `f('a') = 1`, `f('b') = 3`, `f('d') = 2`
  Some k-subsequences of `s` are:
- `"**ab**bbdd"` -> `"ab"` having a beauty of `f('a') + f('b') = 4`
- `"**a**bbb**d**d"` -> `"ad"` having a beauty of `f('a') + f('d') = 3`
- `"a**b**bb**d**d"` -> `"bd"` having a beauty of `f('b') + f('d') = 5`

Return **an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences \*\***whose **beauty** is the **maximum** among all **k-subsequences\*\***. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

**Notes**

- `f(c)` is the number of times a character `c` occurs in `s`, not a k-subsequence.
- Two k-subsequences are considered different if one is formed by an index that is not present in the other. So, two k-subsequences may form the same string.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "bcca", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 1, and f('c') = 2.
The k-subsequences of s are:
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('a') = 2
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3
There are 4 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 3.
Hence, the answer is 4.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abbcd", k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 2, f('c') = 1, and f('d') = 1.
The k-subsequences of s are:
abbcd having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') + f('c') + f('d') = 5
abbcd having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') + f('c') + f('d') = 5
There are 2 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 5.
Hence, the answer is 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105`
- `1 <= k <= s.length`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int countKSubsequencesWithMaxBeauty(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length(), count[] = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            count[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        Arrays.sort(count);
        if (k > 26 || count[26 - k] == 0)
            return 0;
        long res = 1, comb = 1, mod = (long)1e9 + 7, bar = count[26 - k], pend = 0;
        for (int freq : count) {
            if (freq > bar) {
                k--;
                res = res * freq % mod;
            }
            if (freq == bar) pend++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            comb = comb * (pend - i) / (i + 1);
            res = res * bar % mod;
        }
        return (int)(res * comb % mod);
    }
}
```
