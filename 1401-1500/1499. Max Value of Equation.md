## Problem

You are given an array ```points``` containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane, sorted by the x-values, where ```points[i] = [xi, yi]``` such that ```xi < xj``` for all ```1 <= i < j <= points.length```. You are also given an integer ```k```.

Return **the maximum value of the equation **```yi + yj + |xi - xj|``` where ```|xi - xj| <= k``` and ```1 <= i < j <= points.length```.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint ```|xi - xj| <= k```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The first two points satisfy the condition |xi - xj| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.
No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= points.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```points[i].length == 2```
	
- ```-10^8 <= xi, yi <= 10^8```
	
- ```0 <= k <= 2 * 10^8```
	
- ```xi < xj``` for all ```1 <= i < j <= points.length```
	
- ```xi``` form a strictly increasing sequence.



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxValueOfEquation(int[][] points, int k) {
        int res = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int r = 0;
        int rMax = 0;
        for (int l = 0; l < points.length - 1; l++) {
            if (rMax == l) {
                max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                r = l + 1;
                rMax = r;
            }
            while (r < points.length && points[r][0] - points[l][0] <= k) {
                int v = points[r][0] + points[r][1];
                if (max < v) {
                    max = v;
                    rMax = r;
                }
                r++;
            }
            if (points[rMax][0] - points[l][0] <= k) {
                res =
                        Math.max(
                                res,
                                points[rMax][0] - points[l][0] + points[rMax][1] + points[l][1]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
