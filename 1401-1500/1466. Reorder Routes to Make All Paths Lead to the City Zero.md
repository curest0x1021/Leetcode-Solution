## Problem

There are ```n``` cities numbered from ```0``` to ```n - 1``` and ```n - 1``` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by ```connections``` where ```connections[i] = [ai, bi]``` represents a road from city ```ai``` to city ```bi```.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city ```0```), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city ```0```. Return the **minimum** number of edges changed.

It's **guaranteed** that each city can reach city ```0``` after reorder.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/13/sample_1_1819.png)

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/13/sample_2_1819.png)

```
Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 0
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```2 <= n <= 5 * 104```
	
- ```connections.length == n - 1```
	
- ```connections[i].length == 2```
	
- ```0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1```
	
- ```ai != bi```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minReorder(int n, int[][] connections) {
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[] vis = new boolean[n];
        List<List<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        for (int[] tup : connections) {
            adj.get(tup[0]).add(tup[1]);
            adj.get(tup[1]).add(-tup[0]);
        }
        q.offer(0);
        vis[0] = true;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int node = q.poll();
            for (int it : adj.get(node)) {
                if (!vis[Math.abs(it)]) {
                    vis[Math.abs(it)] = true;

                    if (it > 0) {
                        count++;
                    }
                    q.offer(Math.abs(it));
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
