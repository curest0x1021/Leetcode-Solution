## Problem

Given an array of integers ```nums``` and an integer ```limit```, return the size of the longest **non-empty** subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to ```limit```**.**

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 
Explanation: All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
Output: 3
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 10^5```
	
- ```1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9```
	
- ```0 <= limit <= 10^9```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums, int limit) {
        ArrayDeque<Integer> maxQ = new ArrayDeque<>();
        ArrayDeque<Integer> minQ = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int best = 0;
        int left = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            while (!maxQ.isEmpty() && nums[right] > nums[maxQ.peekLast()]) {
                maxQ.removeLast();
            }
            maxQ.offerLast(right);
            while (!minQ.isEmpty() && nums[right] < nums[minQ.peekLast()]) {
                minQ.removeLast();
            }
            minQ.offerLast(right);
            while (nums[maxQ.peekFirst()] - nums[minQ.peekFirst()] > limit) {
                if (maxQ.peekFirst() == left) {
                    maxQ.removeFirst();
                }
                if (minQ.peekFirst() == left) {
                    minQ.removeFirst();
                }
                left++;
            }
            best = Math.max(best, right - left + 1);
        }
        return best;
    }
}
```
