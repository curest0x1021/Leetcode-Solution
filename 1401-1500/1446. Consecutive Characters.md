## Problem

The **power** of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Given a string ```s```, return **the **power** of** ```s```.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= s.length <= 500```
	
- ```s``` consists of only lowercase English letters.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxPower(String s) {
        int max = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < s.length()) {
            int start = i;
            while (i + 1 < s.length() && s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 1)) {
                i++;
            }
            max = Math.max(max, i - start + 1);
            i++;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
