## Problem

You are asked to cut off all the trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as an ```m x n``` matrix. In this matrix:


	
- ```0``` means the cell cannot be walked through.
	
- ```1``` represents an empty cell that can be walked through.
	
- A number greater than ```1``` represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height.


In one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west. If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off.

You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes ```1``` (an empty cell).

Starting from the point ```(0, 0)```, return **the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees**. If you cannot cut off all the trees, return ```-1```.

**Note:** The input is generated such that no two trees have the same height, and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/trees1.jpg)

```
Input: forest = [[1,2,3],[0,0,4],[7,6,5]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Following the path above allows you to cut off the trees from shortest to tallest in 6 steps.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/trees2.jpg)

```
Input: forest = [[1,2,3],[0,0,0],[7,6,5]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The trees in the bottom row cannot be accessed as the middle row is blocked.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: forest = [[2,3,4],[0,0,5],[8,7,6]]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can follow the same path as Example 1 to cut off all the trees.
Note that you can cut off the first tree at (0, 0) before making any steps.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```m == forest.length```
	
- ```n == forest[i].length```
	
- ```1 <= m, n <= 50```
	
- ```0 <= forest[i][j] <= 109```
	
- Heights of all trees are **distinct**.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} forest
 * @return {number}
 */
var cutOffTree = function(forest) {
    const trees = [];
    for (let row = 0; row < forest.length; row ++ ) {
        for (let col = 0; col < forest[0].length; col++ ) {
            if(forest[row][col] >1) trees.push(forest[row][col])
        }
    };    
    trees.sort(function(a,b){ return a > b ? 1 : -1});

    let count = 0;
    let found;
    let startPosition = [0,0];
    let visited = {};
    let key, current;
    let row, col
    let stack = [];
    let nextStack = []
    let target

    for (let i=0; i <trees.length; i++) {
        target = trees[i]
        visited = {};
        nextStack = [startPosition];
        count--; //so we don't count the starting position of each iteration

        while (nextStack.length && !found) {
           stack = nextStack;
           nextStack = [] 
           count++;
           for (let j=0; j <stack.length; j++) {
                [row, col] = stack[j];
                key = `${row}:${col}`;

                if(!forest[row] || !forest[row][col]) continue
                if(found || visited[key]) continue;

                visited[key] = true;
                current = forest[row][col];

                if(current === target) {
                    found = true;
                    startPosition = [row,col];
                    break;
                } else {
                    nextStack.push([row+1, col]);
                    nextStack.push([row-1, col]);
                    nextStack.push([row, col+1]);
                    nextStack.push([row, col-1]);
                }
            };

        }

        if(!found) return -1;
        found = false;
    };

    return count;
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
