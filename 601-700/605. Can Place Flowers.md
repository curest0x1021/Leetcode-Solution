## Problem

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array ```flowerbed``` containing ```0```'s and ```1```'s, where ```0``` means empty and ```1``` means not empty, and an integer ```n```, return **if** ```n``` new flowers can be planted in the ```flowerbed``` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

 
**Example 1:**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```
 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104```
	
- ```flowerbed[i]``` is ```0``` or ```1```.
	
- There are no two adjacent flowers in ```flowerbed```.
	
- ```0 <= n <= flowerbed.length```



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0 && n > 0) {
                boolean left = i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0;
                boolean right = i == flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0;
                if (left && right) {
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    n--;
                }
            }
            if (n == 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return n == 0;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
