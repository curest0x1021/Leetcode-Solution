## Problem

You are given the ```root``` of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer ```val```.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals ```val``` and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return ```null```.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/12/tree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/12/tree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range ```[1, 5000]```.
	
- ```1 <= Node.val <= 107```
	
- ```root``` is a binary search tree.
	
- ```1 <= val <= 107```



## Solution (Java)

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode searchBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        while (root != null && root.val != val) {
            if (root.val > val) {
                root = root.left;
            } else {
                root = root.right;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
