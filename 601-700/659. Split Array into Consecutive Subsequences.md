## Problem

You are given an integer array ```nums``` that is **sorted in non-decreasing order**.

Determine if it is possible to split ```nums``` into **one or more subsequences** such that **both** of the following conditions are true:


	
- Each subsequence is a **consecutive increasing sequence** (i.e. each integer is **exactly one** more than the previous integer).
	
- All subsequences have a length of ```3```** or more**.


Return ```true```** if you can split **```nums```** according to the above conditions, or **```false```** otherwise**.

A **subsequence** of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e., ```[1,3,5]``` is a subsequence of ```[1,2,3,4,5]``` while ```[1,3,2]``` is not).

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 3, 4, 5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: true
Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 3, 4, 5
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to split nums into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 3 or more.
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```1 <= nums.length <= 104```
	
- ```-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000```
	
- ```nums``` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.



## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPossible = function(nums) {
  const count = nums.reduce((acc, num) => {
    acc[num] = (acc[num] || 0) + 1
    return acc
  }, {})
  const needed = {}

  for (const num of nums) {
    if (count[num] <= 0) {
      continue // eslint-disable-line
    }
    count[num] -= 1
    if (needed[num] > 0) {
      needed[num] -= 1
      needed[num + 1] = (needed[num + 1] || 0) + 1
    } else if (count[num + 1] > 0 && count[num + 2]) {
      count[num + 1] -= 1
      count[num + 2] -= 1
      needed[num + 3] = (needed[num + 3] || 0) + 1
    } else {
      return false
    }
  }
  return true
};
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
