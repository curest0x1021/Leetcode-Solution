## Problem

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with ```n``` nodes labeled from ```1``` to ```n```, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from ```1``` to ```n```, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array ```edges``` of length ```n``` where ```edges[i] = [ai, bi]``` indicates that there is an edge between nodes ```ai``` and ```bi``` in the graph.

Return **an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of **```n```** nodes**. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

 
**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-1-graph.jpg)

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

 
**Constraints:**


	
- ```n == edges.length```
	
- ```3 <= n <= 1000```
	
- ```edges[i].length == 2```
	
- ```1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length```
	
- ```ai != bi```
	
- There are no repeated edges.
	
- The given graph is connected.



## Solution (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    private int[] par;

    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        int[] ans = new int[2];
        int n = edges.length;
        par = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            par[i] = i;
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int lx = find(edge[0]);
            int ly = find(edge[1]);
            if (lx != ly) {
                par[lx] = ly;
            } else {
                ans[0] = edge[0];
                ans[1] = edge[1];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private int find(int x) {
        if (par[x] == x) {
            return x;
        }
        return find(par[x]);
    }
}
```

**Explain:**

nope.

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
